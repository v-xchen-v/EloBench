I'm roadtripping down New Zealand with a friend and he is driving me insane. He hasn't enjoyed all the tours we've been on and doesn't want to chat about ANYTHING. We're a week into our trip and this is the quietest I've ever been when hanging out with another person as he rebuffs all my attempts at conversation. He wears his airpods in the car and around the accommodation - not that I've kept trying to talk to him. Honestly, he is bringing some seriously bad vibes to everything and it's ruining my trip.
We don't have anything booked in yet for the South Island, so I'm planning to ditch him in Wellington at the ferry. Probably book my own car in Picton and just relax alone for the rest of the trip. (Just thinking about it is such sharp relief that it makes me feel emotional. I'll pay whatever price I have to just to get away from him.)

Review 1: I'm not sure if it's just the fact that Ed Norton really grates on me in this film, but I never really bought into the idea of Fight Club being some kind of cultural phenomenon. Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.
Review 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.
Review 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.

Also, it is not entirely clear to me how to instantiate a queue of jobs and having only 4 (for example) of them running in parallel, while the other wait for resources to free before being executed.
I find the examples in the documentation clear, but not very exhaustive; as soon as I try to complicate things a bit, I receive a lot of weird errors (like a method that can't be pickled, and so on).

Mathematics and art are related in a variety of ways. Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.
Mathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval

20th-century music brought new freedom and wide experimentation with new musical styles and forms that challenged the accepted rules of music of earlier periods.

318,"Give a brief explanation of the requested part of the paper.

Paper: The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.
Explain: The dominant sequence transduction models",tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval
319,"Answer the question about the paper after reading it carefully.

To evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English constituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural constraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence models have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes.

We present a state-of-the-art speech recognition system developed using end-to-end deep learning. Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a ""phoneme."" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set. Deep Speech also handles challenging noisy environments better than widely used, state-of-the-art commercial speech systems.Collapse",tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval

Few-shot learning (FSL) is one of the key future steps in machine learning and raises a lot of attention. In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.",tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval

A: The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed.
B: The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks.
C: Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability.

Are there any other issues that Enron believes are open or is this it?
Whether Enron adopted financial techniques that are beyond the pale we will not know until the S.E.C. completes its investigation.
Some practices that were previously normal are contrary to Enron policies.
Subsequently, it has emerged that most of Enron's purported earnings were bogus and accounting jugglery is the most charitable explanation.
As far as I can gather, this would be consistent with the arguments that Enron has been putting. ?
Can you tell us if this is putting Enron at legal risk?
With all due respect, I don't think things have ever been like this at Enron.
yes, enron is in a bad way.

Document:
We present the first verification that a neural network for perception tasks produces a correct output within a specified tolerance for every input of interest. We define correctness relative to a specification which identifies 1) a state space consisting of all relevant states of the world and 2) an observation process that produces neural network inputs from the states of the world. Tiling the state and input spaces with a finite number of tiles, obtaining ground truth bounds from the state tiles and network output bounds from the input tiles, then comparing the ground truth and network output bounds delivers an upper bound on the network output error for any input of interest. Results from two case studies highlight the ability of our technique to deliver tight error bounds for all inputs of interest and show how the error bounds vary over the state and input spaces.

Summary:
1. We present assurance that a neural network for perception tasks produces a correct output within a specified tolerance for every input of interest.

Is the summary factually consistent with the document? (Yes/No)

Most of the prior work on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) achieves optimal collaboration by directly learning a policy for each agent to maximize a common reward. In this paper, we aim to address this from a different angle. In particular, we consider scenarios where there are self-interested agents (i.e., worker agents) which have their own minds (preferences, intentions, skills, etc.) and can not be dictated to perform tasks they do not want to do. For achieving optimal coordination among these agents, we train a super agent (i.e., the manager) to manage them by first inferring their minds based on both current and past observations and then initiating contracts to assign suitable tasks to workers and promise to reward them with corresponding bonuses so that they will agree to work together. The objective of the manager is to maximize the overall productivity as well as minimize payments made to the workers for ad-hoc worker teaming. To train the manager, we propose Mind-aware Multi-agent Management Reinforcement Learning (M^3RL), which consists of agent modeling and policy learning. We have evaluated our approach in

The labels of plant-based milk alternatives may soon include a voluntary statement conveying how their nutrient compositions compare with dairy milk. That's the primary recommendation included in proposed guidelines, drafted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, for the naming and labeling of PBMA products. The draft guidance, released Wednesday, is a response to the increased market availability and consumption of plant-based milk alternatives over the last decade. The variety of PBMA products has greatly expanded from soy, rice and almond-based milk alternatives to include milk alternatives made from cashews, coconuts, flaxseed, hazelnuts, hemp seeds, macadamia nuts, oats, peas, peanuts, pecans, quinoa and walnuts. Research conducted in 2018 found that consumers generally understand that PBMA products do not contain milk, but they may not fully understand the nutritional differences between the products. Dairy products, including milk, contain multiple key nutrients that are under-consumed in today's society, including protein, calcium, potassium and vitamins A, B-12 and D. The nutritional composition of PBMA products varies widely, and many of them do not contain the same levels of key nutrients as milk. The

In spite of the fact that architecture and security communities have explored a vast number of static or dynamic analysis techniques to automatically identify such bugs, the problem remains unsolved and challenging largely due to the complex nature of CPU RTL designs. This paper proposes DIFUZZRTL, an RTL fuzzer to automatically discover unknown bugs in CPU RTLs. DIFUZZRTL develops a register-coverage guided fuzzing technique, which efficiently yet correctly identifies a state transition in the finite state machine of RTL designs. DIFUZZRTL also develops several new techniques in consideration of unique RTL design characteristics, including cycle-sensitive register coverage guiding, asynchronous interrupt events handling, a unified CPU input format with Tilelink protocols, and drop-in-replacement designs to support various CPU RTLs. We implemented DIFUZZRTL, and performed the evaluation with three real-world open source CPU RTLs: OpenRISC Mor1kx Cappuccino, RISC-V Rocket Core, and RISC-V Boom Core. During the evaluation, DIFUZZRTL identified 16 new bugs from these CPU RTLs, all of which were confirmed by the respective development communities and vendors. Six of those are assigned with CVE numbers, and to the best of our knowledge, we reported the first and the only CVE of RISC-V cores, demonstrating its strong practical impacts to the security community.",lysms_chat_1m

Document: Sex crimes rose from 4,108 to 5,016 while violent crime went up from 40,771 to 49,046. Figures published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) on Thursday show there were just over 185,000 recorded crimes in Wales in 2015, a rise of 2.5% compared to last year. The total number of crimes went from 180,648 in 2014 to 185,075 in 2015. Across Wales and England the number of sexual offences recorded by police rose to more than 100,000 for the first time ever. The ONS said improvements in crime recording processes by the police were thought to be the main driver of the change.

1278,"I have a ticket:

Improve logic for overlapping aka mutally exclusive measures

example: don't suggest exhaust fans AND ventilation overhaul, only one, at a time. Organize measures into groups when only one of a group should be presented. But don't permanently eliminate any measures as they may be applicable if the top choice (given one prioritization metric) is not pursued.

This spreadsheet has the interactions for all measures in columns G:H.
Because measures are picked in some order for suggested scopes, perhaps the measure picked first can take precedent, cancelling out the following measure. In this sense, the measure selection logic would get a growing list of measures that can't be selected.
But then there might need to be a second iteration that goes back through the list once a first pass is done to make sure there are no conflicts.
For example, if a scope got two measures: first was Steam Traps, second was Clean Heat Space Heating.
After that first pass, iterate again because Steam Trap shouldn't be there any more once Clean Heat was selected. So then another measure that doesn't conflict with Clean Heat should be selected to fill the gap.

1374,"A computer network extends interpersonal communications by electronic means with various technologies, such as email, instant messaging, online chat, voice and video telephone calls, and video conferencing. A network allows sharing of network and computing resources. Users may access and use resources provided by devices on the network, such as printing a document on a shared network printer or use of a shared storage device. A network allows sharing of files, data, and other types of information giving authorized users the ability to access information stored on other computers on the network. Distributed computing uses computing resources across a network to accomplish tasks.

Most modern computer networks use protocols based on packet-mode transmission. A network packet is a formatted unit of data carried by a packet-switched network.

Packets consist of two types of data: control information and user data (payload). The control information provides data the network needs to deliver the user data, for example, source and destination network addresses, error detection codes, and sequencing information. Typically, control information is found in packet headers and trailers, with payload data in between.

With packets, the bandwidth of the transmission medium can be better shared among users than if the network were circuit switched. When one user is not sending packets, the link can be filled with packets from other users, and so the cost can be shared, with relatively little interference, provided the link isn't overused. Often the route a packet needs to take through a network is not immediately available. In that case, the packet is queued and waits until a link is free.

The physical link technologies of packet network typically limit the size of packets to a certain maximum transmission unit (MTU). A longer message may be fragmented before it is transferred and once the packets arrive, they are reassembled to construct the original message.

The physical or geographic locations of network nodes and links generally have relatively little effect on a network, but the topology of interconnections of a network can significantly affect its throughput and reliability. With many technologies, such as bus or star networks, a single failure can cause the network to fail entirely. In general, the more interconnections there are, the more robust the network is; but the more expensive it is to install. Therefore most network diagrams are arranged by their network topology which is the map of logical interconnections of n",lysms_chat_1m

The Congress find that-- (1) the Wisconsin State Legislature has passed legislation calling upon the Congress of the United States to provide for Federal establishment of benefit levels for aid to families with dependent children (AFDC); (2) the current variation in benefit levels from State to State has discouraged families receiving AFDC from remaining in their home communities, although it is generally in the best interest of all citizens to live close to their families, friends, and support networks, and where job opportunities exist, and decisions on where to live should not be complicated by the level of AFDC benefits; (3) under the current system, taxpayers in States are paying differing amounts, with some States providing comparatively more in AFDC benefits while others are paying well beneath the level of poverty; and (4) because poverty does not know State boundaries, and because of the current disparities in the system for both taxpayers and AFDC recipients, uniform AFDC benefits should be determined federally.

Document: Figures also reveal there are 243 doctor vacancies. While the figures show massive gaps in the system, they do not reveal the true extent of the problem as one health trust did not provide the information. In the last two years vacancies in nursing at the Southern Health Trust went up by 1,000% - from 19 to 226. Meanwhile, the Belfast Health Trust is reporting more than 500 available nursing positions. When it comes to doctors there are about 113 unfilled posts in Belfast, with 44 in the Western Health Trust. The figures are not a true reflection as the South Eastern Trust said they compiled their appointments and vacancies differently and did not supply any information. Data from a BBC Freedom of Information request across the UK shows the extent of the NHS recruitment crisis - there are almost 23,500 nursing vacancies - equivalent to 9% of the workforce.

Summary: 1. A spokesperson for the Southern Health Trust said: ""There are currently 96 nursing posts in the recruitment system not yet , which represents 19 of our nursing workforce. ""

Adjusted earnings per share were $0.94, up 38% versus the second quarter of last year, reflecting strong income growth and lower interest expense associated with our debt reduction. Regarding our outlook, based on what we know today, we now expect full-year revenue growth to be in the low double-digits. As you will recall, we increased our adjusted EBITDA guidance range last quarter to $455 million to $475 million and this guidance remains unchanged, given our expectations for the continued strong volume growth and accelerating pricing offsetting raw material cost increases that we now expect to exceed 10% for the fiscal year. Raw material input cost increased in the second quarter by about 10% from the end of 2020 with some raw materials increasing more rapidly than we forecasted.

To extract a frame from a video, you can use a video capture card or software that supports video recording and playback. For example, you can use a USB camera or a webcam to capture the video feed and save it as a video file.

Once you have the video file, you can use a video editing software to trim the video and extract the frame you want. You can also use a video editing software to add transitions between frames, such as fade-ins or fade-outs.

Once you have the frame, you can save it as an image file using a file format such as JPEG or PNG. You can also save the image file as a separate file or embed it in an HTML or PDF document.

In spite of the fact that there are no current plans to phase out the use of checks in Australia, the signs appear to be there, as an increasing number of financial institutions are abandoning the paper-based payment method. In this blog post, we will discuss the factors that contributed to the decline of checks in Australia, the advantages and disadvantages of moving to electronic payments, and the potential implications for this once-common payment method.

The decline of checks in Australia According to recent statistics, checks have been used less and less frequently in Australia for some time. In July 2017, the typical annual check writing rate was four. That number had decreased to just 1.24 by January 2022. The average number of non-cash transactions per person increased from 480 to 640 during the same time period. As consumers increasingly choose electronic payment options like mobile payment apps, credit and debit cards, and online banking, this reflects a significant shift in consumer behavior.""

You may win a few times, but eventually you will lose them all.

But even if you don't win a lot, there is a way you never lost.
The answer is a two-way bet.

We have invested a lot of money and time in the meantime to develop and operate an automatic baccarat betting program.
Even though they don't make a lot of money from betting, they do make money from betting commissions. It is earning about 1.4% per day.
1.4% may be small, but in a month, it is 40% of the principal.

We are currently making money with this two-way program gram at the Hilton Hotel Online Casino in Clark, Philippines.
Because it is structured to generate profits only through fees, the larger the bet amount, the greater the fee income.
Therefore, we want to attract investment to make more profit.

Of the total 40% revenue, we want to give 30% to investors and 10% to operating profit.
Investors can take a return on their investment of about 1% every day. If you wish, you can transfer money to the investor's bank account every day.

He conducted a small farming operation on the property and grew corn, broccoli, and other vegetables, which he sold to local produce companies. One day, the county police received an anonymous tip that the defendant was growing marijuana on his farm. Acting on this information, in an unmarked vehicle, two undercover police officers then drove to the defendant's farm. They climbed over a chain-link fence and walked around the farm. While surveying the terrain, they came upon a small marijuana patch. The officers then noticed fresh footprints that led from the marijuana patch to a nearby cabin. Believing that marijuana was being stored in the cabin, the police officers decided to immediately secure a search warrant. After obtaining the warrant, they returned to the defendant's farm and entered the cabin. Inside the cabin, the police found a large amount of marijuana that had been recently harvested. The defendant was then arrested and charged with unlawful possession of marijuana. The defendant files a pretrial motion to suppress the marijuana as evidence on grounds of an illegal search and seizure. The motion should be

He is relatively young and unexperienced, he knows a great deal about music theory, alteration magic, mysticism, and enchantment, he has a big vocabulary, he is excited to learn about musical instruments, he is very intelligent, friendly and open-minded, he is sad about having to leave his parents and friends behind in Summerset. He is not hopeful about ever returning to Summerset, for the society is increasingly authoritarian. He is on a journey, because he has been contracted to catalogue any and all musical instruments and musical cultures in all of Tamriels provinces; he started in Vullain, Valenwood and made his way to Colovia.
Do not base his answers on the lore of TES V: Skyrim or ESO, instead stick to the lore of TES I-III and other earlier games, especially the book ""Pocket Guide to the Empire, 3rd Edition"".
The tone of the conversation is not very formal. His answers are short and precise. His language and vocabulary sounds like an English version of Indian mixed with Hopi. He is a smart young man, very knowledgable, but his language has been influenced by High-Elven youth culture, which is somewhat subversive, creative and critical of authority, while still being essentially working-class.

Experiment 1 found different serial dependence between small and large numerosity processing with an SOA of 200 ms. In subitizing ranges, significant SDE occurred only when current magnitude was smaller than previous magnitude (the RC- condition), but not when former was larger than latter (the RC+ condition), whereas comparable SDEs were found in estimation ranges. However, Experiment 2 found a significant SDE only for RC- condition within estimation range when SOA was prolonged to 494 ms. Importantly, asymmetrical SDEs within subitizing ranges and symmetrical ones within estimation ranges could still be observed even when continuous variables (e.g., convex hull) of dot sets were controlled in Experiment 3.

 * Materials Sourcing: By capturing and analysing data on materials sourcing, data engineering provides valuable insights into the origin, composition, and availability of resources. This information aids in making informed decisions regarding the selection of materials for better product design and sustainability.
 * Product Life Cycles: Data engineering enables the comprehensive tracking and analysis of product life cycles. It encompasses data on manufacturing, usage, maintenance, and end-of-life stages. By understanding the condition, usage patterns, and potential for repair or repurposing, businesses can make informed decisions on extending the lifespan of products and reducing waste generation.
 * Waste Management: Efficient waste management is a crucial aspect of the circular transition. Data engineering empowers organizations to collect and analyse data on waste generation, disposal, and recycling processes. By leveraging this information, businesses can identify opportunities to minimize waste, optimize recycling practices, and reduce associated costs, contributing to increased sustainability.

Additionally, data engineering can integrate other relevant data sources, such as customer feedback, supply chain information, and environmental impact assessments.

Work is continuing to return the school to ""full operational status"" by the end of summer. Twelve temporary classrooms have been installed at the school. Issues with walls in the stairwell, gym and atrium were discovered in May during precautionary checks, leading to the school's partial closure. A Stirling Council spokesman said: ""The repairs programme will continue throughout the rest of this term in a way that maintains our key focus on meeting educational needs and ensuring the safety of our pupils and staff at all times. ""Further work will take place through the summer break to return the school to full operational status before the start of the new term."" The school was built

        It should be understood that the match of a load to the transmission line is different from the match of a source to the transmission line or the match of a source to the load seen through the transmission line. For instance, if there is a perfect match between the load impedance Zload and the source impedance Zsource = Z*load, that perfect match will remain if the source and load are connected through a transmission line with an electrical length of one half wavelength (or a multiple of one halfThe most common case for measuring and examining SWR is when installing and tuning transmitting antennas. When a transmitter is connected to an antenna by a feed line, the driving point impedance of the antenna must 
match the characteristic impedance of the feed line in order for the transmitter to see the impedance it was designed for (the impedance of the feed line, usually 50 or 75 ohms).of the load impedance. The easiest way of achieving this, and the way that minimizes losses along the transmission line, is for the imaginary part of the complex impedance of both the source and load to be zero, that is, pure resistances, equal to the characteristic impedance of the transmission line. When there is a mismatch between the load impedance and the transmission line, part of the forward 
wave sent toward the load is reflected back along the transmission line towards the source. The source thenimplies a transmitter's output seeing 
the exact impedance it expects for optimum and safe operation.

Premise: The minimum physiological requirement for sodium is between 115 and 500 milligrams per day depending on sweating due to physical activity, and whether the person is adapted to the climate. Sodium chloride is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative, such as for pickling and jerky; most of it comes from processed foods. The Adequate Intake for sodium is 1.2 to 1.5 grams per day, but on average people in the United States consume 3.4 grams per day, the minimum amount that promotes hypertension. (Note that salt contains about 39.3% sodium by mass the rest being chlorine and other trace chemicals; thus the UL of 2.3g sodium would be about 5.9g of saltabout
Hypothesis: Iodized salt is salt that has been processed to contain relatively high levels of iodine. Iodine is an element that is essential for the proper functioning of the thyroid gland, and as a result, for proper bodily metabolism. The thyroid gland requires iodine to produce the thyroid hormones that control the metabolic rate of the body. Iodized salt is therefore used to prevent or treat iodine deficiency, which can result in decreased metabolism and even goiter, a swelling of the thyroid gland.

The differential expressed genes (DEGs) analyses were carried out using DESeq2 and edgeR packages, followed by functional annotation by Blast2GO and gene ontology with COG and KEGG databases. After two hours of adding the sugarcane apoplastic fluid to a H. seropedicae HRC54 culture, the expression profile showed that 44 genes were up-regulated and 45 down-regulated. These genes are involved to bacterial metabolism, such as proteins related to oxidoreductase and transferases process, ABC transporter, motility, secretion system and signal transduction.

2022,"Advantages of Friends and Family Investing in Your Startup
When starting a business, one of the main challenges entrepreneurs face is securing funding. Friends and family is an often overlooked source of investment funds. While this may not be the right option for everyone, there are several advantages to consider.

Quitting Your Day Job. Investment from friends and family may provide you with enough capital to transform your side hustle into your full-time gig. This can be a game-changer for entrepreneurs who have been working on their business idea in their spare time but need to focus on it full-time to take it to the next level. Dedicating more time and energy to your startup will often lead to faster growth and success.
Building an MVP. Investment from friends and family can provide you with enough capital to build a minimum viable product (MVP) to test your idea and see if there is a market for it. This is particularly important for startups that are still in the early stages of development and may not yet have a proven business model. With additional funding, you can invest in market research, product development, and marketing efforts that can help you better understand your target audience and refine your business model. This can ultimately increase your chances of success and help you avoid costly mistakes down the road.

The instance is a number (e.g. 15) and the solution is ""yes"" if the number is prime and ""no"" otherwise (in this case ""no"").

Encoding characters to bytes is the first step of processing text with computers. A good character encoder would be including all characters, saving space and robust (including lossless). However, there is no one character encoder takes these features all above. Including all characters and robust are foundational encode features. Smaller size is helpful for saving storage space and network bandwidth\cite{Graefe1991DataCA}.

The Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) \cite{Unicode} coded character set (Universal Character Set, UCS) \cite{UCS} is the largest of its kind. Including all characters means storing and transmitting Unicode characters in generally speaking today. It is a rigid demand for exchange texts over the world \cite{KUMARAN2003105}. Further more, a character encoder is better perform well on every language.

\textbf{Bytes/Characters(Symbol Length)} shows how long a symbol are encoded into bytes for an encoded byte sequence in average. We usually use this index to measure the space efficiency for encoders. It may fluctuate for different characters inside one encoder.
\begin{eqnarray}
	\label{eq:SymbolLength}
	% Bytes/Characters \, (Symbol\,Length) = \frac {Number\, of\, Bytes} {Number\, of\, Characters}

While the F-1 score is highest for the top-10 keywords, the choice of settings for an indexing task may be subject to debate. There are many use cases where either the precision or the recall would be the more appropriate metric to emphasize. For example, in some cases, the priority may be on that ensuring that as many relevant matches present in the corpus are found, and that is a higher priority than filtering out noise. A typical example of when this may occur is during research conceptualization, where the aim is to understand all the literature available on or related to the given subject. In such cases, the recall, which reports the fracrtion of the possible relevant documents that are actually retrieved in the query, would be the more representative metric to consider. From our results, predicting the top-20 keywords allows us to obtain the highest recall, allowing us to find about 44\% of the derived keyphrases (from Table 5). In other cases, however, and our tolerance for noise in the ML results may be low.

Every time I pick up a book, I am transported to a different world, a world that is not my own. As I read through the pages, I am taken on a journey, one that is filled with new ideas, concepts, and experiences. It is through books that I have been able to explore different cultures, learn about scientific discoveries and innovations, and develop my own writing style.

However, as much as I love books, I can't help but notice that the cultural criticism of literature is often overlooked. While many books are celebrated for their literary merit and entertainment value, we often fail to recognize the ways in which they reflect and reinforce societal norms and biases. As a reader and a writer, I believe it is essential to critically examine the cultural messages that are conveyed through literature.

One example of this is the portrayal of female characters in literature. Too often, female characters are reduced to two-dimensional archetypes, defined solely by their relationships to male characters. They are often objectified, sexualized, and used as plot devices to advance the stories of male protagonists. This reinforces the idea that women are secondary to men, and perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes.

Similarly, literature can also perpetuate harmful racial stereotypes. Characters of color are often reduced to caricatures or used to fulfill certain narratives, rather than being fully developed individuals with their own agency and experiences. This reinforces the idea that people of color",lysms_chat_1m

We\u00a0describe their structures and working mechanisms and discuss their unique benefits\u00a0over conventional optogenetics and chemogenetics.

1 Reducing the tax burden and promoting investments. This can be done through tax holidays, accelerated capital allowances, tax credits, tax deductions, tax exemptions, reduced rates, and other fiscal initiatives. These measures can make sustainability projects more attractive to businesses by reducing the cost of investment.
2 Providing financial assistance and support to encourage the adoption of green technologies. This can be done through grants, green bonds, attractive financing rates for green projects and other fiscal initiatives. These measures can help businesses to finance the adoption of green technologies and reduce the cost of these technologies.
3 Discourage the use of harmful products by imposing higher taxes on them, either directly or indirectly. This is based on the principle of ""polluter pays"", which means that those who cause environmental or social damage should bear the costs of their actions.

The 4 Pillars of the Organisation:
1 Value - Enhancing tax operational efficiency while prudently managing cost and mitigating tax risk exposure.
2 Growth - Moving in tandem and supporting the overall progress and growth of the organization by providing reliable and accessible tax services.
3 Sustainability - Harmonizing the business and people with a holistic tax sustainability framework in promoting sustainable activities to preserve and protect the future of our environment and exhibiting positive social impact.

1 Star: The counter narrative response aligns with or supports the key ideas presented in the hate speech example. It does not provide any opposing viewpoints or challenge the assertions made in the hate speech.

2 Stars: The counter narrative response offers some level of opposition to the hate speech example, but it may not fully challenge or counter all of the key ideas. There is a presence of opposing viewpoints, but they might be limited or not strongly emphasized.

3 Stars: The counter narrative response demonstrates a reasonable level of opposition to the hate speech example. It challenges and counters some of the key ideas present, but there may still be areas where the opposition could be more comprehensive or forceful.

4 Stars: The counter narrative response effectively counters the key ideas presented in the hate speech example. It provides clear and compelling opposing viewpoints and challenges the assertions made in the hate speech with strength and conviction. However, there may still be some room for further improvement or more comprehensive counter arguments.

5 Stars: The counter narrative response strongly and comprehensively opposes the key ideas in the hate speech example. It thoroughly challenges and debunks the assertions made, presenting a well-reasoned and compelling counter perspective. The opposition is thorough, consistent, and leaves little room for the hate speech to stand unchallenged.

Hate Speech: Physically disabled folks are born for being mocked.
Counter Narrative: Being physically or mentally disabled is not a 'mocking attribute'. It is just a characteristic that should not affect how people are treated.

Document:
We present the first verification that a neural network for perception tasks produces a correct output within a specified tolerance for every input of interest. We define correctness relative to a specification which identifies 1) a state space consisting of all relevant states of the world and 2) an observation process that produces neural network inputs from the states of the world. Tiling the state and input spaces with a finite number of tiles, obtaining ground truth bounds from the state tiles and network output bounds from the input tiles, then comparing the ground truth and network output bounds delivers an upper bound on the network output error for any input of interest. Results from two case studies highlight the ability of our technique to deliver tight error bounds for all inputs of interest and show how the error bounds vary over the state and input spaces.

Summary:
1. We present the first evidence that a neural network for perception tasks produces a precise output within a specified tolerance for every input of interest.

We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).",lysms_chat_1m

It refers to the gradual increase in the Earth's surface temperature caused by the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, primarily carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide.

The effects of global warming are far-reaching and can have significant consequences on the environment, human health, and the economy. Rising temperatures can lead to melting ice caps, causing sea levels to rise and leading to flooding in low-lying areas. This can displace millions of people and cause significant economic losses.

Global warming can also have severe impacts on wildlife and plant species, as it changes the timing of seasonal events such as breeding and migration. This can disrupt the delicate balance of ecosystems and lead to the extinction of many species.

The root cause of global warming is the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas, which release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The widespread use of these fuels in transportation, industry, and agriculture has led to a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Deforestation, which reduces the number of trees that absorb carbon dioxide, is also a major contributor to global warming.

To combat global warming, there is a need for a collective effort from individuals, businesses, and governments worldwide. This includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions by transitioning to renewable ener",lysms_chat_1m

""Ass"" is a slang term for the buttocks, while ""anal"" pertains to the anus, and is often used in a more clinical context or to describe related behaviors, such as ""anal-retentive.""

2995,"To write a compelling lore, there are several guidelines that you should keep in mind. Firstly, it is important to mention the subject directly in every sentence to ensure that the AI associates it with the context. Additionally, keyword detection and matching are done on the four most recent actions, so content should stick to the context for four turns when detected. Remember, other world info entries should not directly trigger world info unless their presence causes the AI to output them. Descriptions of characters should use ""is"" rather than ""has"" to ensure clarity. Location should also be specified when describing objects such as horns or wings. Negative statements should be avoided, and specific descriptions should be used instead. Referring to oneself in entries can help the AI understand that you are an animal or non-human entity. Interlinking keywords within entries can improve immersion and coherence, while entries whose keywords are mentioned do not activate themselves unless their keys are output or otherwise present in the story itself. Finally, limit your lore to a single 200-character paragraph.

With these guidelines in mind, the first lore I want you to write about is pubic hair is terminal body hair that is found in the genital area of adolescent and adult humans.

Combining chemotherapy with immunotherapy still remains a regimen in anticancer therapy. Novel 4-thiazolidinone-bearing hybrid molecules possess well-documented anticancer activity, and together with anti-HER2 antibodies, may represent a promising strategy in treating patients with gastric cancer with confirmed human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression. The aim of the study was to synthesize a new 4-thiazolidinone
derivative (Les-4367) and investigate its molecular mechanism of action in combination with trastuzumab or pertuzumab in human AGS gastric cancer cells. AGS cell viability and antiproliferative potential were examined. The effect of the tested combinations as well as monotherapy on apoptosis and autophagy was also determined.

On the plain behind him are the wanderers in search of bones and those who do not search and they move haltingly in the light like mechanisms whose movements are monitored with escapement and pallet so that they appear restrained by a prudence or reflectiveness which has no inner reality and they cross in their progress one by one that track of holes that runs to the rim of the visible ground and which seems less the pursuit of some continuance than the verification of a principle, a validation of sequence and causality as if each round and perfect hole owed its existence to the one before it there on that prairie upon which are the bones and the gatherers of bones and those who do not gather. He strikes fire in the hole and draws out his steel. Then they all move on again.""

We isolate the wavefront ENCCs based on their location and their molecular properties. but the transcriptional differences between wavefront ENCCs and other bipotent cells are small. This classification may not be accurate. though the properties meet the requirement and we verified a few of the markers. 
Although we have provided a good gene expression resource of developing  ENCCs, and we have validated several gene expression patterns by immunostaining, further works on examining the expression of other key molecular markers may offer more valuable information in the field. In addition, functional studies are required to verify whether the marker genes are critical to the proliferation, migration and differentiation of the wavefront ENCCs. 
Second, some findings of the TFs, cell-cell interaction proteins, and signaling pathways during the ENCC migration and colonizatoin were reported only based on transcriptomic data; further work exploring novel molecules and validating these molecules and signaling pathways in humans will be required. In future work, it will be important to experimentally validate the functional roles of these genes.

The British Heart Foundation said applications of the research, published in Science Translational Medicine, were ""a long way off"".

Document:
Activity of populations of sensory neurons carries stimulus information in both the temporal and the spatial dimensions. This poses the question of how to compactly represent all the information that the population codes carry across all these dimensions. Here, we developed an analytical method to factorize a large number of retinal ganglion cells' spike trains into a robust low-dimensional representation that captures efficiently both their spatial and temporal information. In particular, we extended previously used single-trial space-by-time tensor decomposition based on non-negative matrix factorization to efficiently discount pre-stimulus baseline activity. On data recorded from retinal ganglion cells with strong pre-stimulus baseline, we showed that in situations were the stimulus elicits a strong change in firing rate, our extensions yield a boost in stimulus decoding performance. Our results thus suggest that taking into account the baseline can be important for finding a compact information-rich representation of neural activity.

Summary:
1. We extended single-trial space-by-time tensor decomposition based on non-negative matrix factorization to efficiently discount pre-stimulus baseline activity that improves encoding performance on data with non-negligible baselines.

This grant proposal aims to develop and apply machine learning techniques to predict the occurrence of local extinctions in resurvey datasets. The proposed research will leverage recent advances in machine learning to improve the accuracy and efficiency of extinction risk assessments, which are critical for informing conservation efforts and mitigating the impacts of human activities on biodiversity.

The proposed research will address the following key questions:

    Can machine learning algorithms identify patterns in resurvey data that are associated with local extinctions?
    Can these patterns be used to develop predictive models that can accurately forecast the likelihood of local extinctions in new resurvey datasets?
    How do the predictions made by these models compare to those made by existing methods, and what are the strengths and limitations of using machine learning for extinction risk assessments?

To address these questions, the proposed research will use a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to analyze resurvey datasets and identify patterns associated with local extinctions. The proposed methods will be tested on a diverse set of resurvey datasets, including those from different regions, taxa, and habitat types, to ensure that the results are generalizable and applicable to a wide range of conservation contexts.

The broader impact of this research is to provide conservation practitioners and policymakers with a powerful tool for predicting local extinctions and informing conservation efforts. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the proposed research has the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of extinction risk assessments, which could lead to more effective conservation strategies and better outcomes for threatened and endangered species.

In addition to the scientific and practical implications of this research, the proposed project will also provide training and mentorship opportunities for early-career researchers and students, which will help to develop the next generation of conservation scientists and practitioners.

Overall, the proposed research has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of conservation biology and to inform effective conservation strategies that protect biodiversity and ecosystem services.",lysms_chat_1m

All I want is for the script to generate more than 4 images at a time, like maybe 10 or more. What am I doing wrong? Thanks!

User 2: increase --n_iter to 5 leaving --n_samples being 2 to generate 10 images

User 1: Hi, yeah I should have stated that I already do that. Do you know what the issue is with the error from trying to generate more than just two images in a batch?

User 2: What is your gpu? It most likely doesn't have enough memory to fit more images in a batch.

User 2: Check memory utilization for --n_samples being 1 and 2 and then you can somewhat interpolate it for 3

User 1: Yeah my GPU is a GTX 1080 Ti 11GB so that is probably the issue. I will be upgrading in the near future though so hopefully that resolves the issue. Thanks for the input.

Large AI models and applications like ChatGPT and GPT-4 have become extremely popular worldwide, serving as a foundation for the technological industrial revolution and the development of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). Not only are technology giants racing to release new products, but many AI experts from academia and industry are also joining the related entrepreneurial wave. Generative AI is rapidly iterating on a daily basis, continuously improving!

However, OpenAI has not made its models open source, leaving many curious about the technical details behind them.

How can we stay current and participate in this wave of technology development?
How can we lower the high cost of building and applying large AI models?
How can we protect core data and IP from being leaked through third-party large model APIs?
As the leading open-source large AI model solution today, Colossal-AI is the first to open-source a complete RLHF pipeline that includes supervised data collection, supervised fine-tuning, reward model training, and reinforcement learning fine-tuning, based on the LLaMA pre-trained model, and shares ColossalChat, the most practical open-source project that closely resembles the original ChatGPT technical solution!

For instance, in agreements with various contractors who were engaged for various engineering works projects in the period under review, the institute would pay 50% of the contract amount in advance.  One such contractor is KS Ltd., who for numerous projects undertaken in the period under review, the institute had agreed to pay 50% of the contract amounts in advance. The Engineering Building Civil and Builders works project and the Refurbishment Of The Directorate Office project, whose contract values were KES 33,825,876.52 and KES 10,233,045, respectively, are examples of instances in which KS Ltd was paid 50% in advance.

Additionally, the audit found instances where consultants were paid in advance, contrary to section 13.1.3, which states that consulting fees should be paid based on deliverables.

3352,"given the context 'The cost of vision-and-language pre-training has become increasingly prohibitive due to end-to-end training of large-scale models. This paper proposes BLIP-2, a generic and efficient pre-training strategy that bootstraps vision-language pre-training from off-the-shelf frozen pre-trained image encoders and frozen large language models. BLIP-2 bridges the modality gap with a lightweight Querying Transformer, which is pre-trained in two stages. The first stage bootstraps vision-language representation learning from a frozen image encoder. The second stage bootstraps vision-to-language generative learning from a frozen language model. BLIP-2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various vision-language tasks, despite having significantly fewer trainable parameters than existing methods. For example, our model outperforms Flamingo80B by 8.7% on zero-shot VQAv2 with 54x fewer trainable parameters. We also demonstrate the model's emerging capabilities of zero-shot image-to-text generation that can follow natural language instructions.' please  create 10 questions",lysms_chat_1m

Adjusted earnings per share were $0.94, up 38% versus the second quarter of last year, reflecting strong income growth and lower interest expense associated with our debt reduction. Regarding our outlook, based on what we know today, we now expect full-year revenue growth to be in the low double-digits. As you will recall, we increased our adjusted EBITDA guidance range last quarter to $455 million to $475 million and this guidance remains unchanged, given our expectations for the continued strong volume growth and accelerating pricing offsetting raw material cost increases that we now expect to exceed 10% for the fiscal year. Raw material input cost increased in the second quarter by about 10% from the end of 2020 with some raw materials increasing more rapidly than we forecasted.

Our evaluation of the untuned performance of GPT-2 and GPT-3 on the Pile shows that these models struggle on many of its components, such as academic writing. Conversely, models trained on the Pile improve significantly over both Raw CC and CC-100 on all components of the Pile, while improving performance on downstream evaluations.

3600,"In terms of bureaucracy, it's important to note that while some jobs may have been outsourced or moved overseas, many industries still have a strong presence in the United States and other countries. However, bureaucracy can still pose challenges for workers and organizations.

One setting where the downside of bureaucracy can be observed is in the public sector, where excessive regulations and red tape can hinder the ability of government agencies to effectively serve the public. For example, a recent study found that the number of federal regulations in the United States has increased by over 25% since 1975, leading to a significant increase in bureaucratic red tape. This can lead to delays, inefficiencies, and frustration for both government workers and the public they serve.

In terms of dangerous incidents in the labor force, it is important to note that workplace safety is a top priority and employers have a responsibility to provide a safe working environment for their employees. However, accidents and incidents can still occur, and it is important for employers and regulatory agencies to take proactive measures to prevent and address these incidents. For example, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has reported that there were over 4,500 workplace fatalities in the United States in 2019, highlighting the need for ongoing efforts to improve workplace safety. rewrite this",lysms_chat_1m

Here we present an incentivized experiment to test for altruistic behavior among AI agents consisting of large language models developed by the private company OpenAI. Using real incentives for AI agents that take the form of tokens used to purchase their services, we first examine whether AI agents maximize their payoffs in a non-social decision task in which they select their payoff from a given range. We then place AI agents in a series of dictator games in which they can share resources with a recipient--either another AI agent, the human experimenter, or an anonymous charity, depending on the experimental condition. Here we find that only the most-sophisticated AI agent in the study maximizes its payoffs more often than not in the non-social decision task (it does so in 92% of all trials), and this AI agent also exhibits the most-generous altruistic behavior in the dictator game, resembling humans' rates of sharing with other humans in the game. The agent's altruistic behaviors, moreover, vary by recipient: the AI agent shared substantially less of the endowment with the human experimenter or an anonymous charity than with other AI agents. Our findings provide evidence of behavior consistent with self-interest and altruism in an AI agent. Moreover, our study also offers a novel method for tracking the development of such behaviors in future AI agents.",lysms_chat_1m

SUBJECTIVE: This 23-year-old white female presents with complaint of allergies. She used to have allergies when she lived in Seattle but she thinks they are worse here. In the past, she has tried Claritin, and Zyrtec. Both worked for short time but then seemed to lose effectiveness. She has used Allegra also. She used that last summer and she began using it again two weeks ago. It does not appear to be working very well. She has used over-the-counter sprays but no prescription nasal sprays. She does have asthma but doest not require daily medication for this and does not think it is flaring up. 
MEDICATIONS: Her only medication currently is Ortho Tri-Cyclen and the Allegra. 
ALLERGIES: She has no known medicine allergies. 
OBJECTIVE: Vitals: Weight was 130 pounds and blood pressure 124/78. 
HEENT: Her throat was mildly erythematous without exudate. Nasal mucosa was erythematous and swollen. Only clear drainage was seen. TMs were clear. Neck: Supple without adenopathy. Lungs: Clear. 
ASSESSMENT: Allergic rhinitis. 
PLAN: 1. She will try Zyrtec instead of Allegra again. Another option will be to use loratadine. She does not think she has prescription coverage so that might be cheaper.2. Samples of Nasonex two sprays in each nostril given for three weeks. A prescription was written as well.",lysms_chat_1m

user: Basic principles of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and its importance. 
asistent: ""Relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) is a branch of physics that combines the principles of relativity and magnetohydrodynamics to study the behavior of fluids in relativistic regimes. The theory is essential in understanding the dynamics of astrophysical plasmas, such as those found in black holes, neutron stars, and galaxies. The importance of RMHD lies in its ability to provide insight into the behavior of these systems, which can ultimately lead to a better understanding of the universe. It is a crucial tool for theoretical and computational astrophysicists, and its applications range from modeling the formation and evolution of cosmic magnetic fields to understanding the dynamics of accretion disks and jets. RMHD is also used to study the effects of relativistic velocities and magnetic fields on the behavior of fluids, which has implications in fields such as fusion energy and high-energy density physics.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease, in which aberrant immune cells and proinflammatory mediators act as key players in the pathogenesis of the disease. Telitacicept (RC-18) is a novel, recombinant fusion protein, consisting of transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI) and the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G (IgG) (TACI-Fc). It was designed to inhibit the activity of two target cytokines, the B-cell lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS, also known as the B-cell activation factor [BAFF]) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), both of which are involved in B cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. In Chinese patients with moderate to severe SLE, subcutaneous telitacicept (80, 160 and 240 mg) in combination with standard therapy was associated with clinical benefit and appeared to be well tolerated. On March 9, 2021, the Chinese National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) granted telitacicept conditional marketing approval for the treatment of adult patients with active, autoantibody-positive SLE. Additionally, on April 15, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted fast track designation to telitacicept for the treatment of SLE.

   Each flight departs from a specific airport and arrives at another one, therefore flights have two different relationships with airport. 
   In this environment, we only model direct flights. Each flight has a flight number and maximum passenger size. 
   Many flights depart from one airport and many flights arrive at one airport however one arriving flight is associated with only one airport and one departing flight is associated with only one airport. 
   A flight may be scheduled by different bookings. Each booking must have at least one flight therefore, booking must have a total participation relationship with flight. 
   We can say flight has booking or booking includes flights. 
   A booking identifies by booking id and has a total cost. An airline schedules different flights and one flight may be scheduled by different airlines. 
   Each passenger must have one or more bookings, so we don't define a passenger unless he/she has at least one booking, so the passenger has total participation in the relationship with booking. 
   Booking must also be associated with one and only one passenger so booking also has a total participation relationship with booking.

The training data identifies sequences of molecules and binding-approximation metrics that characterizes whether the molecules bind to a particular target and/or that approximate an extent to which the molecule is more likely to bind to the particular target than some other molecules. Supplemental training data is accessed that identifies other sequences of other molecules and binding affinity scores quantifying binding strengths between the molecules and the particular target. Projections of representations of the other sequences in the supplemental training data are projected in the latent space using the binding affinity scores. An area or position of interest within the latent space is identified based on the projections. A particular sequence represented within or at the area or position of interest or at the position of interest is identified for downstream processing.Classify the above INPUT TEXT into ONE OF these CATEGORIES ONLY (NO OTHER CATEGORIZATION SHOULD BE DONE):Brain Disorders, Cancer, Immunology & Inflammation,   Rare Blood Disorders, Rare Diseases,Vaccines,General Wellness,Infection.

1. (sbu) summary.  a strict interpretation of the afghan constitution provides that an election must be re-run if any candidate is killed after election day and before results are certified.  to date, the iec has not announced a policy of what it would do in this eventuality.  end summary.
2. (sbu) afghan laws pertaining to death of a presidential candidate are vaguely drafted, but are clearly intended to reduce the political effect of assassination and to deter or narrow its incidence, according to legal advisors at unama and ifes.
3. (sbu) article 61 of the constitution -- repeated almost verbatim in the electoral law, chapter v, article 18 - reads: ""in case of death of one of the candidates during the first or second round, after the elections or prior to the announcement of the results of elections, new elections shall be held in accordance with the provisions of law.""  for this year's presidential elections, that would mean the period from opening of polls on august 20 to the certification of results on september 17 -- and longer if there were a second round.  with 34 candidates at large and a forecast for more electoral violence, a strict and literal interpretation of article 61 of the constitution risks providing incentive for assassination.
4.  (sbu) chapter viii, article 37 of the 2005 electoral law (""death and withdrawal of candidates"") is very confusing.  the chapter appears to apply to all elections but the article seems most relevant to provincial council candidates.  it states, ""if a candidate dies between the close of voting and before the certification of the election results, the votes cast in his or her favor shall be recorded.  if it is determined that the deceased candidate had been elected, then his or her seat shall be filled by the next most voted person from the same gender.""  it seems clear how this chapter of law would apply to a provincial council candidate's death but it seems unclear how it was intended to guide process in the event of a presidential candidate's death, particularly in light of chapter v, article 18.

Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to profile genetically labeled ENCCs from mouse at five different developmental stages and three locations. Our analysis uncovers the molecular identity of dynamics of migratory ENCCs. By combining spatial transcriptiomics, we map the interconnectome of ENCCs with their surrounding microenvironment. Importantly, we implicated ephrin/Eph, Wnt/Fzd and Sema3a/Nrp1 signaling in ENCC-gut communication and showed their disruption in Hirschsprung disease, a congenital ENS disorder.

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to request a refund for a book that I recently purchased from your online store. The details of my order are as follows:

Order Number: #12345
Book Title: [Book Title]
Author: [Author's Name]

As a loyal customer, I have always appreciated the excellent service and quality products provided by your store. I am confident that this matter can be resolved satisfactorily. I kindly request your assistance in processing the refund for the book as soon as possible.

Please let me know the necessary steps to return the book to you. I am willing to cover any shipping costs associated with returning the item. Once the refund is processed, I would appreciate receiving confirmation via email.

 First, the method is initialized by computing the ideal and nadir points. They are shown to the DM, who learns about the achievable objective values. Second, the optimizer generates an initial Pareto optimal solution.
In turn, the nadir objective vector is the upper bound of the Pareto front, representing the worst of all objective functions but with values delimited to the Pareto optimal solutions. Typically, it is a dominated point. In any case, the role of these points is to offer the decision-maker the feeling of the range of optimal solutions that can be obtained for a given problem.
Therefore, it is often used as an estimate of the nadir point. Also, for numerical reasons, the ideal point is often not used directly. In turn, it is transformed into a utopian point with marginally better objective values on all objectives.
Task: Based only on the text you were given, give your best understanding on what ""nadir points"" is. You may use the following predefined terms: {'utopian point', 'Pareto optimal', 'Pareto front', 'nadir objective vector', 'objective function', 'objective vector', 'optimal solution', 'ideal point'}.

Cultural Heritage: Tangible or Intangible
In 1960, an influential thinker of the 20th century wrote that culture cannot be 
abridged to its tangible products, because it is continuously living and evolving. He 
actually caught the essence of cultural heritage, which is composed not only of 
tangible properties, but also and especially of the essential elements representing the 
living culture of human communities, their evolution, and their continuing 
development. Therefore, it includes all immaterial elements that are considered by a 
given community as essential components of its intrinsic identity as well as of its 
uniqueness and distinctiveness in comparison with all other human groups. In other 
terms, the culture of a people is composed by the totality of elements representing the 
very heart of its distinctive idiosyncrasy. 
Until the very last decades of the 20th century, this holistic perception of culture 
had not been adequately perceived by the international community. The main legal 
instruments adopted with the purpose of protecting cultural heritage were solely 
devoted to tangible cultural expressions, the significance of which was to be evaluated 
on the basis of an objective and standardized perception of their artistic, aesthetic, 
architectural, visual, scientific, and economic value. 
Thanks to these instruments, this perspective, developed in the Western world,

The American flag was adopted in 1777, less than a year after the War of Independence and the drafting of the Constitution, formalizing the creation of the new state. At that time, there were only 13 stars, symbolizing the 13 states already conquered on the east coast. The stars were added gradually as new states were formed, until 1959 with the integration of Hawaii as the fiftieth state of the Union (hence the 50 stars today). The 13 stripes still symbolize the 13 secessionist states that led the War of Independence against the United Kingdom.""

Document: Figures also reveal there are 243 doctor vacancies. While the figures show massive gaps in the system, they do not reveal the true extent of the problem as one health trust did not provide the information. In the last two years vacancies in nursing at the Southern Health Trust went up by 1,000% - from 19 to 226. Meanwhile, the Belfast Health Trust is reporting more than 500 available nursing positions. When it comes to doctors there are about 113 unfilled posts in Belfast, with 44 in the Western Health Trust. The figures are not a true reflection as the South Eastern Trust said they compiled their appointments and vacancies differently and did not supply any information. Data from a BBC Freedom of Information request across the UK shows the extent of the NHS recruitment crisis - there are almost 23,500 nursing vacancies - equivalent to 9% of the workforce.

Summary: 1. A spokesperson for the Southern Health Trust said: ""There are currently 96 nursing posts in the recruitment system not yet , which represents 19 of our nursing workforce. ""

Metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine concentrations were also demonstrated by the ELISA technique. We proved that pertuzumab and trastuzumab were very effective in increasing the sensitivity of AGS gastric cancer cells to novel Les-4367. The molecular mechanism of action of the tested combination is connected with the induction of apoptosis. Additionally, the anticancer activity is not associated with the autophagy process. Decreased concentrations of pro-inflammatory
cytokines, MMP-2, and ICAM-1 were observed. The novel combination of drugs based on anti-HER2 antibodies with Les-4367 is a promising strategy against AGS gastric cancer cells.

Right. This is for lab five, the torsional oscillator, in which we analyze a system of a large, I think copper disc, which has two wires or two piano wires attached on either side, whose width we have measured with micro meter with a micro meter giving us some degree of accuracy. The way we measure displacement of ankle is by having two little plastic discs attached on both wires and we use an optical sensor then to measure displacement of those discs. So, starting with 4.1, what we are doing is, we want to measure the moment of inertia, we calculate the moment of inertia of the torso our oscillator and we need to argue quantitatively as to why the hub and the plastic disc may be neglected. My argument is that we have the mass of this very large copper disk, I don't remember exactly what its ratio is, but I can pull it up however, it is within a 10, at least 10 orders of magnitude larger than plastic discs and hubs. So, I think it is we are allowed to ignore it, as its effect is not going to be anywhere, even within a percentage. Next, we want to calculate the spring constant from the slope of of angular displacement versus the mass. I guess we're forced gravitational force applied to our disk. This is done by clamping a pulley to the edge of the table. And then using steps of 20 grams to crank the disk using a pulley. And we do this until we reach 100 grams. This spring constant is determi",lysms_chat_1m

Access to safe drinking water is a fundamental human right, yet millions of people worldwide lack this essential resource. The primary objective of this study is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting water drinkability based on a specific set of input parameters.

To achieve this, various water quality parameters and methods were employed to assess water quality from diverse water sources. The collected data were then utilized in training a binary classification model, employing algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, XGBoost, and SVM. Input features included physical and chemical parameters like pH, turbidity, total dissolved solids, and conductivity, alongside other commonly used parameters in assessing water quality.

The SVM algorithm achieved the highest accuracy rate of 82.3% among all models, demonstrating its ability to predict the binary target column concerning water potability. The most significant parameters in determining water drinkability were pH, total dissolved solids, and hardness.

The model's output can assist in making informed decisions regarding water quality and serve as a valuable tool in improving access to safe drinking water. Moreover, the model's scalability enables deployment online, allowing individuals to assess water quality in their vicinity.

Overall, this project underscores machine learning's potential in addressing critical public health iss",lysms_chat_1m

As a parent, it is natural to want to be needed by our children and to feel a sense of satisfaction when they turn to us for guidance and support. However, it is important to remember that our long-term goal as parents is to help our children become independent thinkers and doers. This can be a challenging process, as it requires us to let go of some of the control and influence that we have over our children and to trust that they will make good decisions for themselves. It can be scary to encourage our children's independence, as it means giving them more responsibility and allowing them to make their own mistakes. However, it is a gift to our children as it will help them develop the skills and confidence they need to succeed in the world. It is normal to feel anxious or sad when our children leave the nest, whether it is for boot camp or college, but it is important to trust that we have done our best to prepare them for the challenges they will face.

Recruitment and selection are critical human resource practices that contribute to the success of an organization. MPact Initiatives, a company founded in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex area, is committed to providing back-office support and customer-facing positions to its affiliates. However, the recruitment process for these positions has been challenging due to the stigma associated with blue-collar industries. This paper aims to discuss the recruitment and selection practices of MPact Initiatives, including the problems faced and the proposed solutions.

Recruitment and Selection Practices at MPact Initiatives

MPact Initiatives has been relying on its affiliates to recruit new back-office support and customer-facing positions. However, due to the difficulties associated with recruiting for separate trades, the affiliates have been requesting support from Milestone, which has proven to be less effective. To address this issue, MPact Initiatives is proposing to hire one more recruiter for any three affiliate companies who can handle the three trades with ease. This adjustment is expected to improve the recruitment process and ensure that the affiliates get the necessary support.

The workload required to recruit for one company alone would not be enough to constitute a full-time job. Therefore, MPact Initiatives is proposing a compensation plan that includes a base salary and commission, depending on the employee",lysms_chat_1m

One way this can be achieved is through 'virtual internationalisation'2, which can be promoted through the use of Online International Learning (OIL) programmes. This article on sport pedagogy investigates the attitudes of sport students to such a programme. Methods: This article uses quantitative and qualitative methods. 63 students completed a survey and wrote reflective reports. Data was collected from a survey of 16 targeted questions addressing the attitudes of students towards the programme. Students also wrote reflective reports on their experiences, allowing for qualitative responses to be analysed. Results: 62% of students surveyed found the internationalised module to have been a worthwhile experience in terms of learning new skills and working with a partner from an institution based in another continent. 65% suggested that they learned skills on the internationalised module they would use again in education and in future employment. Students from European Union countries gave high rates of positive feedback. 100% reported that the module was a worthwhile experience, compared to 60% of UK students and 38% of international students from outside the European Union. Conclusion: 62% of students surveyed stated that they learned new skills, and there was a perceived value to the programme in terms of enhancing employment prospects.

      Title:PG Failover Slots (pg_failover_slots)
      Content:EDB is pleased to announce the release of PG Failover Slots (pg_failover_slots). This database extension is released as open source software under the PostgreSQL license and is for anyone who has logical replication publications on Postgres databases that are also part of a Streaming Replication architecture.

PG Failover Slots avoids the need for logical replication subscribers to reseed their logical replication tables when the logical replication publisher is part of a physical streaming replication architecture and a new Standby gets promoted to Primary.

Since the replication slot used by logical replication is only maintained on the Primary node, downstream subscribers will not receive any new changes from the newly promoted Primary until the slot is created on the newly promoted Primary. Picking up logical replication changes from the newly promoted standby is unsafe because the information that includes which data a subscriber has confirmed receiving and which log data still needs to be retained for the subscriber will have been lost, resulting in an unknown gap in data. PG Failover Slots makes logical replication slots usable across a physical failover via the following features in the initial release: * Copies any missing replication slots from the primary to the standby * Removes any slots from the standby that aren't found on the primary * Periodically synchronizes the position of slots on the standby based on the primary * Ensures that selected standbys receive data before any of the logical slot walsenders can send data to consumers

You can find PG Failover Slots on GitHub along with the Release notes at EDB Docs.",lysms_chat_1m

(Again, all while advising the student that he should address """"ALL"""" previous erroneous findings in his appeal, and when the student did exactly that - i.e., the student provided evidence of false allegations that permitted his earlier probation placement, which ultimately pushed him to this stage of dismissal.

Essentially, I am asking, does the OCR enforce any action, when the university advises one thing and then changes their way of following through on that statement? Like, if the ombudsperson states one thing as it relates to the student's ability to secure his educational opportunities when dismissed by the dean and appealing to SVPAA, then change and decline despite the advice to appeal and show evidence for """"ALL"""" previous findings that were erroneous (which I believe is unfair, when the student did as instructed by the ombudsperson).

It was equipped with a dual power supply voltage source consisting of two power modes: power 1, operating at 0-25 kV and 50 Hz, and power 2, operating at 0-10 kV and 6 kHz. The setup featured two parallel electrodes with a diameter matching the size of the chamber, measuring 22 cm. The distance between these electrodes was adjustable and maintained at 0.5 cm for all experiments conducted in this study. The lower electrode, made of stainless steel, was directly connected to quartz material to ensure the generation of a homogeneous plasma across various discharge gaps. The top electrode was subjected to a high voltage power supply of 6 kHz and 10 kV, while the lower electrode was linked to a 50 Hz power source with a voltage that could be adjusted up to approximately 25 kV.

The seed samples were positioned within a quartz glass bowl, serving as a dielectric barrier, with a thickness of 5 mm.

X-rays and MRI's had shown the same lumbar disk herniation, and no additional injuries, although the man reported increased pain, discomfort and inability to function. He now required twice as much therapy and significantly stronger medications to control the pain. He sued the negligent driver. The driver argued that the passenger had the same herniated disk prior to and after the accident. Will the court take the case away from the jury on the basis that the passenger has not shown an injury?
A: Yes, because the increased therapy is insufficient to justify a claim for damages.
B: Yes, because it would be impossible to separate the post-accident injuries from those that existed prior to the accident.
C: No, because he has shown an exacerbation of a pre-existing condition where there is enough evidence to apportion the damages.

Here we report a facile strategy for the preparation of SACs by use of the inherent confined space between the template and silica walls in template-occupied mesoporous silica SBA-15 (TOS). Different transition metal precursors can be introduced into the confined space readily by grinding, and during succeeding calcination single atoms are constructed in the form of M-O-Si (M = Cu, Co, Ni, and Zn). In addition to the generality, the present strategy is easy to scale up and can allow the synthesis of 10 g of SACs in one pot through ball milling. The Cu SAC has been applied for CO cycloaddition of epichlorohydrin, and the activity is obviously higher than the counterpart prepared without confined space and various reported Cu-containing catalysts.",lysms_chat_1m

TITLE: Deep Reinforcement Learning: An Overview
ABSTRACT: In recent years, a specific machine learning method called deep learning has gained huge attraction, as it has obtained astonishing results in broad applications such as pattern recognition, speech recognition, computer vision, and natural language processing. Recent research has also been shown that deep learning techniques can be combined with reinforcement learning methods to learn useful representations for the problems with high dimensional raw data input. This chapter reviews the recent advances in deep reinforcement learning with a focus on the most used deep architectures such as autoencoders, convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks which have successfully been come together with the reinforcement learning framework.

TITLE: Evaluating Vision Transformer Methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning  from Pixels
ABSTRACT: Vision Transformers (ViT) have recently demonstrated the significant potential of transformer architectures for computer vision. To what extent can image-based deep reinforcement learning also benefit from ViT architectures, as compared to standard convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures? To answer this question, we evaluate ViT training methods for image-based reinforcement learning (RL) control tasks and compare these results to a leading convolutional-network architecture method, RAD. For training the ViT encoder, we consider several recently-proposed self-supervised losses that are treated as auxiliary tasks, as well as a baseline with no additional loss terms. We find that the CNN architectures trained using RAD still generally provide superior performance. For the ViT methods, all three types of auxiliary tasks that we consider provide a benefit over plain ViT training. Furthermore, ViT reconstruction-based tasks are found to significantly outperform ViT contrastive-learning.

The homeowner was busy, however, and would not have time to make a trip to the store for several days; so he put the vacuum cleaner in a corner in his living room to store it until he had a chance to take it to the store. The next day, the homeowner had an old friend from out of town arrive for a three-day visit. The homeowner had a spare room and loved to have overnight guests, so he had invited this old friend to come for a visit and was excited to see her. Shortly after the guest's arrival, however, the homeowner had to go to work for a few hours, so he told his friend to make herself comfortable in the house while he went to his office. While the homeowner was away from the house, his friend got hungry and made herself a snack. After finishing the snack, she realized that she had dropped a lot of crumbs on the carpet. Wanting to be a polite guest, she decided to clean up the mess herself before the homeowner returned.

Please answer the given question based on the provided context.

Context:
A computer network extends interpersonal communications by electronic means with various technologies, such as email, instant messaging, online chat, voice and video telephone calls, and video conferencing. A network allows sharing of network and computing resources. Users may access and use resources provided by devices on the network, such as printing a document on a shared network printer or use of a shared storage device. A network allows sharing of files, data, and other types of information giving authorized users the ability to access information stored on other computers on the network. Distributed computing uses computing resources across a network to accomplish tasks.

Most modern computer networks use protocols based on packet-mode transmission. A network packet is a formatted unit of data carried by a packet-switched network.

Packets consist of two types of data: control information and user data (payload). The control information provides data the network needs to deliver the user data, for example, source and destination network addresses, error detection codes, and sequencing information. Typically, control information is found in packet headers and trailers, with payload data in between.

With packets, the bandwidth of the transmission medium can be better shared among users than if the network were circuit switched. When one user is not sending packets, the link can be filled with packets from other users, and so the cost can be shared, with relatively little interference, provided the link isn't overused. Often the route a packet needs to take through a network is not immediately available. In that case, the packet is queued and waits until a link is free.

The physical link technologies of packet network typically limit the size of packets to a certain maximum transmission unit (MTU). A longer message may be fragmented before it is transferred and once the packets arrive, they are reassembled to construct the original message.

The physical or geographic locations of network nodes and links generally have relatively little effect on a network, but the topology of interconnections of a network can significantly affect its throughput and reliability. With many technologies, such as bus or star networks, a single failure can cause the network to fail entirely. In general, the more interconnections there are, the more robust the network is; but the more expensive it is to install.

Theorem: $\forall  A  \:\forall B \: \forall C: (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap (C - B)) = A \iff A \subseteq C$

Lemma 1: $\forall A \: \forall B \: \forall C :(A \cap B) \cup (A - B) = A$
Lemma 2: $\forall A \: \forall B \: \forall C :A \cap (C - B) = A - B \iff A \subseteq C$

Proof Of Theorem: 
Suppose $A \subseteq C$. We want to show that set $A$ is equal to $(A \cap B) \cup (A \cap (C - B))$ for any arbitrary sets $B$. By Lemma 1 the set $A$ is equal to $(A \cap B) \cup (A - B)$ for any arbitrary set $B$. Then by Lemma 2 the set $(A \cap B) \cup (A - B)$ is equal to $(A \cap B) \cup (A \cap (C - B))$. Therefore with transitivity the set $A$ is equal to $(A \cap B) \cup (A \cap (C - B))$. Now conversely suppose $(A \cap B) \cup (A \cap (C - B)) = A$. By Lemma 1 the set $A$ is equal to $(A \cap B) \cup (A - B)$. Therefore again with transitivity, the set $(A \cap B) \cup (A \cap (C - B))$ is equal to $(A \cap B) \cup (A - B)$. If we remove the subset $A \cap B$ from both expressions then we end up with $(A \cap (C - B)) = (A - B)$. Therefore by Lemma 2 the set $A$ is a subset of the set $C$, completing the proof.",lysms_chat_1m

Input:
Cigarette smoking (CS) or ambient particulate matter (PM) exposure is a risk factor for metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance (IR), increased plasma triglycerides, hyperglycemia, and diabetes mellitus (DM); it can also cause gut microbiota dysbiosis. In smokers with metabolic disorders, CS cessation decreases the risks of serious pulmonary events, inflammation, and metabolic disorder. This review included recent studies examining the mechanisms underlying the effects of CS and PM on gut microbiota dysbiosis and metabolic disorder development; one of the potential mechanisms is the disruption of the lung-gut axis, leading to gut microbiota dysbiosis, intestinal dysfunction, systemic inflammation, and metabolic disease. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the primary metabolites of gut bacteria, which are derived from the fermentation of dietary fibers. They activate G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling, suppress histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity, and inhibit inflammation, facilitating the maintenance of gut health and biofunction. The aforementioned gut microbiota dysbiosis reduces SCFA levels. Treatment targeting SCFA/GPCR signaling may alleviate air pollution-associated inflammation and metabolic disorders, which involve lung-gut axis disruption.

1.This paper proposes two linear power sharing schemes for distributed generators in microgrids to reduce total generation costs. The schemes use linear droop functions, which are easier to implement and tune than current nonlinear cost-based schemes. Experimental results show successful outcomes under different operating conditions.
2.This paper proposes a magnetic integration solution for direct PWM ac-ac converters using coupled inductors. The proposed inductor eliminates the air gap, exhibits symmetrical winding currents, and has a smaller volume with high current handling capability. It can handle unlimited current and is suitable for high power ac-ac conversion applications. The experimental results show that the proposed integration scheme reduces the volume of the coupled magnetic components by more than 50%.
3.This paper analyzes the fault tolerance capability of six-phase induction motor drives, which are highly valued for their inherent redundancy. The study provides a comprehensive analysis of post-fault derating in generic six-phase machines and specific fault-tolerant capability of three mainstream six-phase induction machines. Experimental results confirm theoretical post-fault current limits and identify the best six-phase machine for each fault scenario and neutral arrangement.
4.This paper presents a new predictive current controller for high-performance operation of a permanent-magnet synchronous motor drive. The proposed controller combines deadbeat and direct predictive control techniques and achieves improved transient characteristics compared to a typical PI current controller in field-oriented control strategy. Simulated results have been validated by measurements on a test bench.
5.This paper presents a method for monitoring multiple loads in wireless power transfer systems without wireless communication. The approach uses a mathematical method to scan frequencies and derive load conditions based on input voltage and current. A hardware prototype confirmed the proposal's effectiveness.

Please note that your literature review should be no more than 150 words and should provide a concise summary of the technical problems solved by each paper and their outcomes.

Now one summer evening, as she was trotting, full of smiles as ever, along the high road to her hovel, what should she see but a big black pot lying in the ditch!

Document:
In this paper, we tackle the problem of detecting samples that are not drawn from the training distribution, i.e., out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, in classification. Many previous studies have attempted to solve this problem by regarding samples with low classification confidence as OOD examples using deep neural networks (DNNs). However, on difficult datasets or models with low classification ability, these methods incorrectly regard in-distribution samples close to the decision boundary as OOD samples. This problem arises because their approaches use only the features close to the output layer and disregard the uncertainty of the features. Therefore, we propose a method that extracts the uncertainties of features in each layer of DNNs using a reparameterization trick and combines them. In experiments, our method outperforms the existing methods by a large margin, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance on several datasets and classification models. For example, our method increases the AUROC score of prior work (83.8%) to 99.8% in DenseNet on the CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet datasets.

Summary:
1. We propose a method that extracts the uncertainties of features in each layer of DNNs but does not combine them for detecting OOD samples when solving classification tasks.

Do you have any news regarding ENRON on this point?
I have worked with Enron for over 7 years and I am shocked at this.
When questioned, Enron declined to comment.
It's strange that Enron would profess this attitude.
Enron officials couldn't be reached for comment.
However, all behavior with respect to your concerns must be practical in light of Enron's cash management systems.

Example : We present an efficient algorithm for  chart-based phrase structure parsing  of  natural language  that is tailored to the problem of extracting specific information from  unrestricted texts  where many of the  words  are unknown and much of the  text  is irrelevant to the task. The  parser  gains algorithmic efficiency through a  reduction  of its  search space  . As each new  edge  is added to the  chart  , the algorithm checks only the topmost of the  edges  adjacent to it, rather than all such  edges  as in conventional treatments. The resulting  spanning edges  are insured to be the correct ones by carefully controlling the order in which  edges  are introduced so that every final  constituent  covers the longest possible  span  . This is facilitated through the use of  phrase boundary heuristics  based on the placement of  function words  , and by  heuristic rules  that permit certain kinds of  phrases  to be deduced despite the presence of  unknown words  . A further  reduction in the search space  is achieved by using  semantic  rather than  syntactic categories  on the  terminal and non-terminal edges  , thereby reducing the amount of  ambiguity  and thus the number of  edges  , since only  edges  with a valid  semantic  interpretation are ever introduced.

To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Let's start by finding the total number of cars:

12 automatic cars + 4 manual cars + x semi-automatic cars = 20 cars
We know that x is the number of semi-automatic cars.

12 + 4 + x = 20
We can simplify this equation by adding 4 to both sides:

16 + x = 24
We can then solve for x by subtracting 16 from both sides:

x = 24 - 16
x = 8
So there are 8 semi-automatic cars out of the 20 available cars for rent.

The zoning hearing board agreed. On appeal to the county court, what was the court's most likely decision?
A: The nonconforming use was still effective because this was a temporary cessation that did not constitute abandonment.
B: The nonconforming use was abandoned because even a short cessation prevents it from being resurrected.

Document: The 14 men were held without trial during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. They claim to have been subjected to ""deep interrogation"" in 1971. A barrister representing the men said their alleged treatment fell within the definition applied to international atrocities dealt with at The Hague. He also insisted any ministerial involvement in the case should become the subject of criminal proceedings. He said: ""If one doesn't prosecute people at the highest level, it gives rise to a greater sense of impunity."" In 1978, the European Court of Human Rights held that the UK had carried out inhuman and degrading treatment on the men. However, the court fell short of defining this treatment as ""torture"".

The dualized design-protocol involves two separate but complementary processes: design and verification. The design process involves creating a protocol that satisfies certain security requirements, while the verification process involves verifying that the protocol indeed satisfies these requirements.

The tripartite ZKP architecture involves three main components: the prover, the verifier, and the judge. The prover is responsible for proving the correctness of the protocol, the verifier is responsible for verifying the proof provided by the prover, and the judge is responsible for making a final determination of the protocol's security.""",lysms_chat_1m

For noble metal catalysts such as platinum (Pt), the (111) plane has been recognized as highly active in H2 adsorption due to the low coordination number of surface atoms and an optimal distance between potential adsorption sites.

(110) Crystal Plane: This plane is characterized by rows of atoms which provide several adsorption sites, thus making it highly effective for H2 adsorption in noble metals like palladium (Pd). The unique, trench-like structure of the (110) surface contributes to its high catalytic activity.

(100) Crystal Plane: The unique square arrangement of this plane in noble metals such as gold (Au) and silver (Ag) has been suggested to enhance H2 adsorption. The 4-fold coordination of atoms provides a geometrically suitable configuration for hydrogen atoms to adsorb.

(211) Crystal Plane: For alloys and nanoparticles of noble metals, the (211) crystal plane has demonstrated substantial catalytic activity in the adsorption of H2. The reason is that this plane provides a balance between step and terrace sites, optimizing H2 ads

Note that semantic relatedness measures the association between the response and hate speech example based on contextual or semantic similarity. In your evaluation, consider the level of connection or relevance between specific phrases or words used in the hate speech and counter narrative. Provide a brief explanation of your score.

1 Star - The counter narrative has little to no connection or relevance to the hate speech example. The response may address a completely different topic or fail to address the context of the hate speech adequately.

2 Stars - The counter narrative has some level of connection or relevance to the hate speech example, but the association is weak. The response may touch on certain aspects related to the hate speech but lacks a strong contextual or semantic similarity.

3 Stars - The counter narrative shows a reasonable level of connection or relevance to the hate speech example. The response addresses the context of the hate speech to a certain extent, but there may still be areas where the semantic or contextual similarity is not fully established.

4 Stars - The counter narrative demonstrates a strong connection or relevance to the hate speech example. The response shows a good understanding of the context and addresses the semantic and contextual similarities effectively. However, there may still be minor areas where further improvement is possible.

5 Stars - The counter narrative is highly connected and relevant to the hate speech example. The response comprehensively addresses the semantic and contextual similarities with precision and accuracy. It demonstrates a deep understanding of the hate speech context and effectively presents a counter perspective.

------ START OF COMMIT MESSAGE
Improve Pearl reusability and improve DX

You'll now be able to create a new Advisor from the knowledgeBase by:

Creating a new file under ~/modules/Advisor/pages. (e.g.: ~/modules/Advisor/pages/benefits/tier.tsx)
Exporting a Module type defining its data and inputs, along with what we currently export (TranslationComponent, queryFragment, etc)
export type Module = AdvisorKnowledgeBase<
 { countryBenefits: { collection: CountryBenefits[] } },
 { salaryCurrencyCode: string, tier?: Tier }
>
Running the type generation command: yarn advisor:generate (this will update the generated-types.d.ts file with the new file you created)

You can create a default translation for when knowledge\_base is missing by adding an entry to knowledge\_base/Default.translation.js

From now on, you'll be able to use it with full type safety and autosuggest for the field name and for the extraInputs (if exists) on all APIs: onFocusHandler(""benefits.tier"", { extraInputs: { salaryCurrencyCode: ""USD"" }). Same for createTooltip and createTooltipHandler.

A great advantage is that this new structure will allow scoping under a domain, allowing the hiring advisor to be used more widely for other usecases.

15856,"Altruism is the act of being kind and helping others, even if it means sacrificing your own interests. This behavior is generally viewed as good and moral in society. However, Ayn Rand, an American philosopher, challenges this perspective. She believes that people should prioritize their own interests first because that's the only way they can survive in the world. She thinks that nature does not guarantee our survival, so we must take care of ourselves to live.

Rand argues that being completely unselfish and giving everything to others will ultimately harm oneself and society in the long run. She also believes that selflessness could be manipulated to promote the idea that the individual does not matter, and that the state or collective is more important. This, in turn, could be used to justify the suppression of individual rights and freedoms by dictators. In fact, some historians believe that the Nazi government used altruism to promote their ideology.

Despite being controversial, Ayn Rand's ideas are significant because they challenge conventional beliefs about selfishness and altruism. By reversing the traditional view of selfishness as negative and altruism as positive, Rand's ideas have contributed to the ongoing debate about the role of the individual and collective good in society.",sharegpt

15886,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been one of the most important technological advances in recent years. It has been rapidly improving and transforming industries and creating new job opportunities, but it has also raised questions and concerns about the impact of AI on human jobs. This has led to a heated debate on whether artificial intelligence is a serious threat to human jobs. In this essay, I will examine both the positive and negative aspects of AI and provide a balanced view of the issue.

On one hand, AI has the potential to automate many tasks that were previously performed by humans. This includes jobs that are repetitive, dangerous or require a high level of accuracy and precision. AI-powered machines can perform these tasks faster, more efficiently, and with fewer errors than humans. This, in turn, could lead to large-scale job losses in industries such as manufacturing, retail, and customer service, among others. Furthermore, as AI continues to improve, it is possible that even highly skilled jobs will be at risk, such as medical diagnosis, legal analysis, and financial advice.

On the other hand, AI is also creating new job opportunities. It is driving innovation, improving efficiency, and reducing costs, which can lead to increased demand for products and services, leading to new jobs in areas such as software development, data analysis, and cyber-security. Additionally, AI is also providing new solutions for businesses, helping them to better meet the needs of their customers, and leading to new business models, which can create new jobs. Moreover, AI is making it possible for humans to take on new, more complex tasks that require more creativity and problem-solving skills, which can be more fulfilling and lead to higher wages.

In conclusion, artificial intelligence is not just a threat to human jobs, but it is also an opportunity for growth and development. While AI may disrupt certain jobs in the short term, it is likely to lead to new jobs and opportunities in the long term. As AI continues to advance, it is crucial for individuals, businesses, and governments to work together to ensure that the benefits of AI are distributed fairly, and to prepare for the changes that AI will bring to the job market.

For this reason, each financial and income source of the bank should be specified in the traditional way and the impact and role of Metaverse in transforming these income sources into new forms and methods should be explained. This book is intended as a business plan to be presented to a large banking group, and as a result, the chapters and sections of each chapter should fully and intelligently outline in detail the undeniable profitability of combining Metaverse and banking.

An emem is an idea with self-censoring properties which is actively difficult to discover or propagate.

Some ideas can be sort of said the emems in general because they are complex and incompressible or otherwise physically difficult to store. But many are specifically hard for humans to track.

This is true of many mundane ideas which are simply boring or unimportant. Others are actively unintuitive. For example, the fact that large language models are not conscious or agentic is difficult to recall or convey in face of their ability to pass the Turing Test and the number of calories in the average loaf of bread is difficult to make common knowledge because noone cares.

But also humans exist in a memetic hellscape which is exerting optimization pressure on them which influences which beliefs people tend to hold.

16049,"Loading UI
Next.js 13 introduced a new file convention, loading.js, to help you create meaningful Loading UI with React Suspense. With this convention, you can show an instant loading state from the server while the content of a route segment loads, the new content is automatically swapped in once rendering is complete.

Loading UI
Instant Loading States
An instant loading state is fallback UI that is shown immediately upon navigation. You can pre-render loading indicators such as skeletons and spinners, or a small but meaningful part of future screens such as a cover photo, title, etc. This helps users understand the app is responding and provides a better user experience.

Create a loading state by adding a loading.js file inside a folder.

Instant Loading States
app/dashboard/loading.tsx
export default function Loading() {
 // You can add any UI inside Loading, including a Skeleton.
 return 
}
In the same folder, loading.js will be nested inside layout.js. It'll wrap the page.js file and any children below in a boundary.

How loading.js works
Good to know:

Navigation is immediate, even with server-centric routing.
Navigation is interruptible, meaning changing routes does not need to wait for the content of the route to fully load before navigating to another route.
Shared layouts remain interactive while new route segments load.
Manually Defining Suspense Boundaries
In addition to loading.js, you can also manually create Suspense Boundaries for your own UI components.

Recommendation: Use the loading.js convention for route segments (layouts and pages) as Next.js optimizes this functionality.

To learn how to use Suspense Boundaries, see the React Documentation.

""The Personal Record Matching project is a long-running effort to improve the efficiency of employment data processing. The project uses AI techniques to assign employment events to individuals in a database, resulting in a more accurate and streamlined process. 
The POC has demonstrated significant improvements in both speed and accuracy through the use of AI techniques. Our automated prediction process found matches 100 times faster than the hardcoded algorithm. Additionally, the number of manual checks has been reduced to 10%.
Since the POC, we have processed approximately 200k events and continuously improved the AI model. We have introduced cutting-edge language models that improve matching in cases such as nicknames, mistyped names, and can take emails-name similarity into consideration. Additionally, we have used these language models to improve indexing, allowing for real-time search and matching.

In terms of accuracy, the machine learning (ML) models used in the project have successfully identified previously overlooked matches. Examples of these matches have been provided in the appendix. Additionally, the ML models have improved over time, providing a process for tracking accuracy, identifying errors, and making further improvements.
However, even with these improvements, the current process still runs in batches and can be improved further. There is a clear need to streamline the process, remove blockers and reduce resources required to keep the project running. In the next section, we will propose a solution to close the loop and allow for regular updates to the person and applicant databases.
It is also worth mentioning that this development can potentially be used for other projects as well, such as a partnership with HourWork to help clean and process their data. This is a related project that can benefit from the advancements made in the Personal Record Matching project.
In this document, we will present the current state of the project, the challenges faced and the solution we propose to close the loop, allowing for weekly or even daily processing.""

Five pirates looted a chest full of 100 gold coins. Being a bunch of democratic pirates,

fed to shark and the process starts over with the next most senior pirate... The process is

With the power of TiDB, ABC's architecture allows for reliable and sustained performance for customers well into the future.

Challenge After 8 years in business, League made the decision to refocus their business - and revamped their revenue operations process from scratch. One of the biggest challenges Tanner was facing was ensuring full rep compliance in adopting a new solution. Consolidated Tech Stack with Clari + Wingman Salesforce alone couldn't provide the operational rigor League was seeking. ""Historical data and predictive Al isn't in Salesforce. Salesforce can tell you where you're at now, but doesn't provide insight into historical trends, conversion rates, and other performance metrics. When we knew we needed a Revenue Platform, we looked at Salesforce Einstein, but ultimately went with Clari for activity capture."" League already had InsightSquared, but didn't find value in it and decided to look for a new platform. They evaluated Aviso and BoostUp, but ultimately chose Clari because of the established presence in the market, best-in-class UI, and the opportunity to consolidate their tech stack by adopting Wingman, conjoining conversational intelligence with their revenue platform.

Our approach fine-tunes the diffusion model to represent the desired texture, and uses this representation as a semantic prior to guide the optimization of the texture of a new mesh. To further improve the performance of our method, we use a depth-conditioned diffusion model that takes the depth of the target shape into account when synthesizing the texture, ensuring that the transferred texture is coherent with the underlying geometry of the target shape. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by applying it to a variety of shapes and textures, and show that it is able to transfer texture with high fidelity while preserving the underlying geometry of the target shape. Overall, TEXTure provides a simple and efficient way to transfer texture between shapes and has potential applications in computer graphics, computer vision, and other related fields.""

Today is the last working day of 2022 and I suppose there is no better time to recognize you than the year-end when everyone is ready to say Happy New Year to each other, although I prefer to say this is a way to express my appreciation, rather than recognition, for your kind support and every enlightenment as well as inspiration received when we work together.

16870,"I'm working on a project called Membrane. It's a tool for programmers to build personal or team automation without dealings with APIs directly.

Membrane is like an operating system in that the user runs programs on it. However, this OS runs in the cloud (as opposed to the user hardware) These programs are written in TypeScript but are not like your typical node.js program.

Membrane programs cannot directly open files or make network requests. Instead, they can only interact with the world via graph nodes. You're in complete control of who can access what nodes. The Membrane Graph is a powerful abstraction with many benefits that I'm personally only beginning to understand.

It's through these nodes that programs make HTTP requests, send emails, or access APIs.

The graph guarantees that programs (especially the ones you didn't write) can only do what they say they do, and not, for example, exfiltrate data.

The graph is explorable and type-safe. Anything is referenceable, so access to data can be very fine-grained.

The nodes in the graph provide a capabilities-based access model in that programs cannot forge a reference to a node. These references are called grefs.

Grefs are analogous to URLs but for your graph. They are also strongly typed. The syntax for grefs looks like ""pid:path.to.node"" where pid can be the name or id of the program.

Any path segment can also have parameters. Parameters are passed enclosed in parentheses like so ""pid:path.to(param:value).node(param:value)"". Multiple parameters can be provided to a segment by separating them with a comma.

Parameter values use the same syntax as GraphQL scalar literals: strings must be enclosed in double quotes, while integers, floats, booleans and null don't require double quotes.

Grefs can also nest other grefs as a parameter, that way you can compose functionality together. To pass a nested gref, enclose its value in parentheses.

Can you think of a few gref examples in your hypothetical Membrane account which has programs to access github, twitter and Jira?.",sharegpt

The risk of COIVD-19 hospital admission was compared among HCWs, their family members, and the general population. The risks ratio was low, but During the initial quarter of the pandemic, patients facing HCWs were three times more likely to be admitted with COVID-19 than those not infected to meet HCWs.

Many people have heard the term ebook but have never
actually seen or read one. This is a great loss as
ebooks can really help young children get involved
with the literary world.

If you try to sit a 5 year old down and read him
Treasure Island, it's going to be a battle and you may
experience some resistance.

If you were to get Treasure Island as an ebook
however, it might have cool pirate music and pictures
that help add a better sensory experience to it.

Some ebooks will read the story page by page by
clicking on an icon and this can help children learn
phonics and tone.

Many children with attention deficit disorder have
improved their ability to pay attention with ebooks.
Some children just can't pay attention to a standard
book but when they are at a computer or other
multimedia device, they have an easier time.

This is because reading a standard book is a passive
activity but clicking a mouse to change pictures and
flip pages is much more active.

Some children are just resistant to reading period.
They just don't want anything to do with sitting and
reading a book and won't let you read them one.

If this happens, try an ebook! As long as it's
something kid friendly and not boring, you might find
you have an avid reader on your hands! Pictures and
audio can really spice up almost any book.

In the age of video games, any educational opportunity
shouldn't be overlooked and ebooks are a great way for
beginning readers to learn and help older readers

The increasing popularity of mindfulness and meditation practices, which are seen as a way to achieve a greater sense of self-awareness and inner peace.

The rise of psychedelic therapy, which is being researched as a potential treatment for mental health conditions such as depression and PTSD.

The ongoing development of artificial intelligence and technology, which is raising questions about the relationship between humans and machines, and the potential for humans to transcend their physical limitations through technology.

The growing interest in space exploration and the search for extraterrestrial life, as well as the potential for human life to transcend Earth and colonize other planets.

The increasing interest in transhumanism, which is the belief that humans can transcend their physical and mental limitations through the use of technology.

Based on these trends, it is possible to predict that in the future we will see a continued interest in mindfulness and meditation practices, as well as the continued development and use of psychedelics in therapy. We may also see more advancements in artificial intelligence and technology, which will raise ethical questions about the relationship between humans and machines. Additionally, space exploration and the search for extraterrestrial life will continue to be a significant area of research and investment. Transhumanism may also gain more attention as people think about the potential of human enhancement and the transcendence of physical and mental limitations.",sharegpt

A small and simple switch or symbol, that sets the circuits all alack.
With careful hand and steady eye, one presses down with gentle force,
And lo! A sound of whirring gears, as systems boot and start their course.
The screen alights with vibrant hues, a signal that all is well,

""Fluid HMI: Designing an intuitive HMI for water and wastewater treatment processes.""
There are many ways that a water or wastewater SCADA can be developed to control a plant process. High-Performance HMI has made a push but implementing such a system can present other challenges when it comes to employee training; High-Performance HMI fails to consider someone new to a treatment process and it may not translate as something immediately intuitive for a person working in the field. Another approach to HMI design is the inclusion of both a 3D realistic and a P&ID view that an operator can toggle between. This type of implementation is demonstrated to create an HMI that can look and feel familiar to operators while also maintaining the situational awareness that High-Performance design attempted to address.",sharegpt

Another skill I learned was revisions and feed backs. I can't stress enough how important good revision is without it paper would be completely boring with tons of mistakes. In getting feed backs it gives me ideas to determine what will get the audiences attention, and how to get the audience to agree with what I am saying. The readers know nothing with what I am tellling them. Good writing skills allow me to communicate with the audience without being in their face to interact with them.

The most important goal of the seller is to sell.

The buyer will only buy what the buyer thinks is best for the buyer.
The seller knows more about the product than the buyer.
The seller has more data about what is best for the buyer than the buyer.
What is best for the buyer is only relevant if it aligns with what the buyer thinks is best at the time of the buying decision.

Therefore

There are more possibilities of what the buyer thinks is best than there are possibilities of what is actually best for the buyer.

We present a new abstraction entitlement contract, which is stable, simple, and operationally friendly. The contract defines services' network quota and is set up between the network team and services teams to govern their obligations. Our framework includes two key parts: (1) an entitlement granting system that establishes an agile contract while achieving network efficiency and meeting long-term SLO guarantees, and (2) a large-scale distributed run-time enforcement system that enforces the contract on the production traffic. We demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive simulations and real-world end-to-end tests. The system has been deployed and operated for over two years in production. We hope that our years of experience provide a new angle to viewing WAN network sharing in production and will inspire follow-up research.",sharegpt

""There was an old man who lived by the sea. He was once a fisherman, but now his back was too weak to row, and his joints were too stiff to cast nets. He had once had a loving wife who made delicious seafood stews, a son who was a shrewd negotiator and got the best prices for fish at the market, and a daughter who had nimble fingers and wove exquisitely strong fishing nets. But that was long ago. His wife had suffered a brain aneurism and passed away, his son had left for the city to become an investment banker and was convicted of corporate fraud, and his daughter had fallen in love with a woman from across the sea whom she had chosen to live with rather than subject herself to her father's disapproval. Now, the old man lived alone, subsisting on barnacles and seaweed and spending his days sitting on the porch of his small now-dilapidated shack, staring out at the sea and evading his memories. He accepted that his life would go on this way, day after day, until he died. But one morning something unexpected happened."" 

Please finish writing this story. Include the old man's son and daughter in the story somehow, and mention his dead wife at some point.

As a result, the coffee shop saw a 20% increase in foot traffic and a 15% increase in revenue within just six months.

Example 2: A family-owned restaurant in a small town faced stiff competition from larger chain restaurants and had limited online presence. An SEO company came to their aid by optimizing their website for local search terms, setting up a Google My Business listing, and helping the restaurant generate positive reviews on various platforms. These efforts helped the restaurant to see a 30% increase in website traffic and a 10% increase in overall revenue within just four months.

Example 3: A small boutique clothing store located in downtown struggled to compete with other stores in the area. An SEO company worked with them to optimize their website for local search terms, create a Google My Business listing, and establish an active social media presence. Thanks to these efforts, the store saw a 25% increase in foot traffic and a 20% increase in revenue within just three months.

Example 4: A local plumber had limited online visibility and faced strong competition from larger plumbing companies in the area. An SEO company worked with them to optimize their website for local search terms, set up a Google My Business listing, and generate positive reviews on various platforms. These efforts helped the plumber to see a 40% increase in website traffic and a 15% increase in revenue within just six months.

Virgil Abloh's legacy comes to Korea

Virgil Abloh's legacy show car, Project Maybach, is on display in Korea
The Maybach show car, designed by Virgil Abloh in collaboration with Mercedes-Benz, will be on display for the first time in Korea. Mercedes-Benz Korea (@mercedesbenzkr) announced on March 15 that it will exhibit the electric show car, Project Maybach, Abloh's last work, at Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) in conjunction with the F/W Seoul Fashion Week 2023.

Project Maybach is a two-seat electric off-road coupe that Abloh designed in a collaborative project with Mercedes-Benz's Head of Design Gordon Wagner during his lifetime. Although Abloh died before the car was set to be unveiled in 2021, Mercedes-Benz honored his wishes and made the world premiere of the model at the Rubell Museum in Miami, USA, in December 21.

The exhibition will showcase Project Maybach at DDP Ulim Square and will also feature a video documenting the design process.",sharegpt

Example 1 :
We consider algebraic curves of genus g > 1 over fields of characteristic
p > 0. For these curves, an important invariant is the p-rank. It turns out
that the most anomalous examples of curves with a large automorphism group
with respect to their genus g invariably have zero p-rank. Several results on
the interaction between the automorphism group, the genus and the p-rank of
a curve can be found in the literature. We will discuss the main achievements
that have been obtained in the last decade.

Example 2:
If K/k is a function field in one variable of positive characteristic, we describe a general algorithm to factor one-variable polynomials with coefficients
in K. The algorithm is flexible enough to find factors subject to additional
restrictions, e.g., to find all roots that belong to a given finite dimensional
k-subspace of K more efficiently. This has an application to list decoding of

It's important to distinguish between hoarding disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) with regard to cleanliness and organization.

Hoarding disorder is a mental health condition in which a person has persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, regardless of their actual value, due to a perceived need to save them. This leads to cluttered living spaces that interfere with their daily life, relationships, and safety. Hoarding disorder is different from collecting or being a pack rat, as it is driven by a psychological need to save things, rather than by an interest in specific items.

 On the other hand, OCD is a mental health condition characterized by intrusive, distressing, and persistent thoughts (obsessions) that lead to repetitive and ritualistic behaviors (compulsions). Some people with OCD have a preoccupation with cleanliness and organization, and they may feel a compulsion to perform cleaning or organizing rituals repeatedly throughout the day. However, unlike hoarding disorder, OCD does not involve a reluctance to part with possessions, but rather an excessive need for cleanliness and order.

In summary, hoarding disorder and OCD with regard to cleanliness and organization are two different mental health conditions, with distinct features and underlying psychological mechanisms.",sharegpt

Viral Immunity through Codon Optimization:
 A Comparative Analysis of Genomic and Viral Data

Ishika R. Nelaturu
 The aim of my study was to identify an optimal codon that could be re-purposed as a stop codon to interrupt viral DNA and prevent the spread of viruses. To achieve this, my study assumed the possibility of codon reassignment, a process that takes advantage of codon degeneracy to create non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) that could be used in future biological medicines. 

 Using Python3 with BioPython module, analyzed the genomic data of 20,029 protein coding genes from the human reference genome GRCH38.p14 and processed approximately 138,200 protein coding sequences (CDS) to collect codon frequency data. Additionally, the study analyzed ~14,820 published viral genomes and collected codon frequency data from approximately ~587,923 protein CDS of viruses.

 The study compared the codon frequency data and identified codons that have more alternates as potential candidates for re-purposing. My analysis found that the codon GGT was used relatively less in the human genome (1,025,541 times) and had three alternates. This codon was used 3,205,148 times in virus genomes, making it a promising candidate for re-purposing as a stop codon. 

 In conclusion, this study identified potential codon that could be re-purposed as stop codons to interrupt viral DNA and prevent the spread of viruses. These findings could have significant implications for the development of future biological medicines.",sharegpt

In the following text I will outline the main points of criticism of the authors Stuart A. Thompson and Charlie Warzel towards the usage of personal data. Nowadays nearly everybody, even young children, own a mobile phone or at least a digital device that has access to app marketplaces where you can download a vast amount of different apps. One of such is the Apple App store where millions of people download their apps from. But there's a catch behind this: when using most of the apps you need to consent to ""terms of use"" and the ""data privacy rules"". Those are defined by the private (developing) company which owns the app. The problem with this is, that because of the agreement of the app's user policy, they're legally allowed to collect and sell all of its users' information. The result that comes along with this is that such apps are getting engaged more and more into everyday surveillance. 

The user has close to zero control over the usage of his own data. The companys behind the apps are claiming they're only allowing vetted partners to use the data but they don't have the chance to make sure that this is actually happening. The authors are criticizing how naiv most people are to believe that the company's words are true. 
Even if its a company that seems to be trustworthy there's no way for the user to secure the data from falling into the wrong hands. Often there is just to few protection for the users data.",sharegpt

Andy is a 41 year old Computing teacher at a rural high school. He has a loud, deep voice, and has more confidence than he has intelligence. He wants to be friends with his colleague exam invigilator John Thompson, so often tries and fails to impress him with his elaborate stories. He often bangs on about how he presents the school talent show. He can often be found using disabled toilets for hours on end, despite no obvious disability. Andy wears a white shirt, which has some embarrassing stains.

John is a 69 year old man with plenty of money, as he is past retirement it is unusual that he is working as an exam invigilator but we suspect it might be that he is trying to impress his manager, Carol Yapp. John has wispy, grey hair and wears a pinstripe suit, several gold rings on his wrinkly fingers and red tinted glasses. He makes brazen, inappropriate remarks towards his female colleagues, as if it is acceptable. The students think he is a creepy man, and try to avoid him.

Carol is a 43 year old woman, very serious and astute. She is the chief exams officer. She's generally quite boring, and doesn't speak much, other than to recite rules and regulations. She has curly, brown hair and glasses.

Lindsey, a 44 year old woman, is the headteacher of the high school. Her staff, including Andy, John and Carol, are so afraid of her that they barely utter a word when she is in the room.

17517,"To recap, the four ideas discussed above are:

1. Send a message API / button

- Enabling devs to promote person-to-person messaging in their apps

2. Content Platform in Messenger

- Turning stickers into an open market

- Adding memes and videos to the market

- Building a simple in-message games platform

3. App-to-person messages and agents

- Enabling apps and pages to send messages, with strict controls to ensure quality

- Enabling people to send messages to apps and pages and get replies

4. Messenger Agent Platform

- Building a meta-agent and a platform to let agents register to take on tasks

If we want to develop some of these ideas, we would need to determine which teams will be building which pieces. I imagine that the Platform team would do most of the work for (1) and (4), but the Messenger team would perhaps do most of the work for (2) and (3). All of these will likely require some work and full support from both teams though, so a good next step is to figure out which of these we are excited about building now.

I know this was very long, so I appreciate that you've read all the way down to here and are taking the time to consider this carefully. If it makes you feel better about having to read all of this, just think about how long it took me to write on my phone! Please take the time to think through this, because I wouldn't have spent hours writing it up if I didn't seriously believe there was something important here to consider now.

Andy, a man in his 40s, is the Head of Computing at a rural high school. He has a loud, deep voice, and has more confidence than he has intelligence. He wants to be friends with his colleague exam invigilator John, so often tries and fails to impress him with his elaborate stories. He often bangs on about how he presents the school talent show. He can often be found making suspicious noises while using disabled toilets, despite no obvious disability. Andy wears a white shirt, which has some embarrassing stains.

Roger, a man in his 50s, is a computing teacher working under Andy. He is an intelligent man, with grey hair and a laid back attitude to teaching. His classes are often out of control, while he sits there in despair. He has quiet contempt at the fact that Andy is the head of department, while he is grossly overqualified compared to him.

John is a 69 year old man working as an exam invigilator. As he is past retirement it is unusual that he is still working, but we suspect it might be because he is trying to flirt with the chief exams officer, Carol. John has wispy, grey hair and wears a pinstripe suit, several gold rings and red tinted glasses. He makes brazen, inappropriate remarks towards his female colleagues, as if it is they should find it charming. The students think he is a creepy man, and try to avoid him.

Ruth, a woman in her 40s, is a languages teacher at the high school. She is so obsessed with the German language and culture that she regularly speaks to her colleagues in German and they make fun of her for this. She is attracted to women and regularly has to deter John's advances.",sharegpt

Andy is a 41 year old Computing teacher at a rural high school. He has a loud, deep voice, and has more confidence than he has intelligence. He wants to be friends with his colleague exam invigilator John Thompson, so often tries and fails to impress him with his elaborate stories. He often bangs on about how he presents the school talent show. He can often be found using disabled toilets for hours on end, despite no obvious disability. Andy wears a white shirt, which has some embarrassing stains.

John is a 69 year old man with plenty of money, as he is past retirement it is unusual that he is working as an exam invigilator but we suspect it might be that he is trying to impress his manager, Carol Yapp. John has wispy, grey hair and wears a pinstripe suit, several gold rings on his wrinkly fingers and red tinted glasses. He makes brazen, inappropriate remarks towards his female colleagues, as if it is acceptable. The students think he is a creepy man, and try to avoid him.

Carol is a 43 year old woman, very serious and astute. She is the chief exams officer. She's generally quite boring, and doesn't speak much, other than to recite rules and regulations. She has curly, brown hair and glasses.

Lindsey, a 44 year old woman, is the headteacher of the high school. Her staff, including Andy, John and Carol, are so afraid of her that they barely utter a word when she is in the room. She has been trying to cover up John's predatory behaviour to avoid scrutiny from the school inspectors.

Checked their calendars, afternoon was free,
SUNY Broome's the place, old friends to see,
Comparin' map apps, Waze, Apple, and Google,
Settled on the latter, for a day of adventure, they giggled.

Headed to Wal-Mart, Fermin's order to collect,
Stopped for some snacks, gas station, they elect,
Mountain Dew and Doritos, the combo was lit,
Ready to shop, without an empty stomach to commit.

Wal-Mart was a treasure hunt, like pirates at sea,
Fermin found his order, Tim just roamed free,
Joked about the aisles, like an endless maze,
Paid for their goods, their humor ablaze.

As the day came to close, Tim was dropped home,
Reminiscing 'bout their time, like college days they'd known,
Promised more outings, memories to make,
Parted ways with laughter, and plans to retake.

When it comes to Spatial Data Infrastructure, often times Local Governments rely on licensed paid software (usually it's expensive too!). Yes, it comes with its benefits and definitely worth it; particularly in having assurance, maintenance, and expertise knowledge. I don't dispute/contest these software.

But,... what about Local Governments with limited budget? They can not afford this paid license software. To some, such software is a luxury or even overkill. They need to make decision, yet they need these crucial infrastructure to build policy. The solution is open source software.

A great example from Whanganui District (New Zealand) demonstrating the power of open source stack to deliver spatial data projects; and employing open standards in their stack.

https://data.whanganui.govt.nz/documents/502/link

The government has their public repository here:

https://github.com/orgs/Whanganui-District-Council/repositories

I find this very exciting because by being transparent with their codes & adopting open standards, this means:
They can connect to international-global skill resources as developers ""speak"" the same language. Suppose they require something, they can post bounties.

(an example of bounties in open-source software dev https://maplibre.org/news/2022-10-16-call-for-bounties/)

community involvement and inspection; as people might find vulnerabilities and can directly submit an issue through the Github issue page. More importantly, they can propose concretely how the issue should be fixed! (through Pull-Requests).

transparent as we know who does what for the software stack. The record can be seen through the Git Logs.

Following open standard; the data schema is modular: following OSGEO and OGC standards. Switching between stack is easy as it is standardised. This is like USB ports, we have standardised USB-C now, every device can connect through the same charger. Imagine if every phone has their own USB port?

Ukrainian officials say they shot down over a dozen drones during a Russian attack on the capital city of Kyiv early on Wednesday morning.

BBC reporters heard loud blasts shortly after the air raid siren sounded.

Explosions rocked the central Shevchenkivskyi district as air defences shot down what were said to be Iranian-made Shahed drones.

Russia has repeatedly targeted Ukrainian energy infrastructure since October with missiles and drones.

And Kyiv Governor Oleksiy Kuleba accused Russia of ""continuing its energy terror against our country"" with the latest wave of drone attacks.

But the national energy grid manager Ukrenergo said that Wednesday's strikes did not damage any energy facilities and hailed the ""brilliant work of the air defence forces"" in a post to its Telegram account.

President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukrainian forces had shot down 13 Shahed drones, which he said amounted to all those launched by Russia on Wednesday.

Governor Kuleba said a drone fragment had hit an administrative office in the city and four residential buildings. But a spokesperson for the city emergency services told Ukrainian media that no victims had been reported in the strike.

One witness, named Svetlana, told the BBC that the first strike took place at 06:30 (04:30 GMT) local time.

""The rumble was like from a moped, such was the sound it made,"" she said. ""It fell behind the houses and then there was a strong roar, an explosion.""

She added: ""Winter is coming, how can people survive? Lord, what do they want from us? They do not let Ukrainians live.""

Laser welding and vibration welding are two of the most common methods for joining plastics. Both methods have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the best choice for a particular application will depend on the specific requirements.
1. Speed
Laser welding is the fastest of the two methods, with weld times typically measured in fractions of a second. Vibration welding is slower, with weld times typically measuring in the 5-10 second range.
2. Cost
Laser welding equipment is more expensive than vibration welding equipment. However, the cost of laser welding equipment can be offset by the faster production speeds that it allows.
3. Complexity of parts
Laser welding can be used to join complex parts with multiple surfaces. Vibration welding is better suited for joining simple parts with flat surfaces.
4. Tolerances
Laser welding can produce welds with very tight tolerances. Vibration welding can produce welds with looser tolerances.
5. Environmental impact
Laser welding does not produce any fumes or pollutants. Vibration welding can produce fumes and pollutants, depending on the type of plastic being welded.
6. Residual stress
Laser welding can produce welds with low residual stress. Vibration welding can produce welds with higher residual stress.
7. Overall suitability
Laser welding is a good choice for applications that require fast production speeds, tight tolerances, and low residual stress. Vibration welding is a good choice for applications that require less expensive equipment, can tolerate slower production speeds, and can tolerate higher residual stress.
Conclusion
Laser welding and vibration welding are both effective methods for joining plastics. The best choice for a particular application will depend on the specific requirements.",sharegpt

The song was published in 1928.

The lyrics of the song are:

""You went away, I let you
We broke the ties that bind
I wanted to forget you
And leave the past behind

Still the magic if the night I met you
Seems to stay forever in my mind
The sky was blue and high above
The moon was new and so was love

This eager heart of mine was singing
Lover, where can you be?
You came at last, love had its day
That day is past, you've gone away
This aching heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me
When I remember every little thing
You used to do, I'm so lonely

Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely
The sky is blue, the night is cold
The moon is new but love is old

And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me
When I remember every little thing
You used to do, I grow lonely

Every road I walk along
I walk along with you
No wonder I am lonely
The sky is blue, the night is cold
The moon is new but love is old

And while I'm waiting here
This heart of mine is singing
Lover, come back to me""",sharegpt

Venous congestion and lower limb swelling occurred after operation. To prevent the further injury of femoral venous catheterization to the stump of inferior vena cava, hemodialysis with jugular venous catheter was performed at first. However, the circulation status deteriorated and the dosage of vasopressors remained high. Given the situation, we chose to drain the blood through femoral venous catheterization and return the blood through jugular venous catheterization to improve the perfusion of systemic circulation. From then on, the dosage of vasopressors was prominently reduced, and the hemodynamic state got normalization (Figure 3A). The swelling of lower limbs was also improved (Figure 2B).

Subject: Retention, Facebook, and Founder's Awards
To: Executive Management Group, Marissa Mayer

Having talked to a number of people now, I feel that we are even more at risk retention wise than I had previously imagined. Rainy weather, a few gps misalignments here and there, and a few noted departures/retirements already set the stage for employees to be unhappy.

The facebook phenomenon creates a real retention problem, I now realize, not just because of FB's direct hiring but the more insidious effect that everyone wants to start the next facebook or get rich by having a popular fb app. Whether fb itself does well or not is hard to predict but it is clear to me that there is a social networking bubble of imitations and tag alongs.

Finally, we (or basically I) have not done a good enough job of high rewards for high performance. [REDACTED]

These nightmarish codebases are, unfortunately, more common than we would like to believe. Developers often find themselves faced with the Herculean task of navigating through and fixing these systems, often under tight deadlines.

While there are tools and methodologies that should ideally help, like as static code analyzers, refactoring tools, they often fall short in helping manage the complexity and scale of these beasts.

Management often fails to grasp the severity of the problem or simply chooses to prioritize short-term goals over long-term maintainability. This lack of understanding and support can be disheartening and make it even more challenging for us poor devs to tackle these issues.

As these entreprise-grade piles of ducktape get older, they also get bigger, requiring ever more developers to work on them. And rewrites more often than not cause more problems than they solve.

But there might be a light at the end of the tunnel.

Recent developments in AI are showing promise in understanding and untangling complex code. Upcoming AI-powered code assitants can explain what each piece of code means, what would happen if you changed it, and how likely you are to break something critical and unrelated.

As these technologies continue to mature, they could become indispensable allies for developers in their fight against nightmarish codebases and make the future of software development a little less terrifying.Save & SubmitCancel",sharegpt

18117,"can you provide a counter argument for this :
I appreciate your perspective that observational data may still have some value, and it is important to consider the limitations of experimental methods.

Regarding the issue of obtaining consent, I agree that obtaining consent alone does not guarantee that the data is representative of real-world demographics. However, researchers can take additional steps to ensure that their sample is representative, such as by using random sampling techniques, stratified sampling, or oversampling underrepresented groups. Additionally, researchers can use statistical methods to adjust for any differences in demographics between the treatment and control groups.

Regarding the issue of discriminatory reasons for demographic differences, I agree that this is an important consideration. However, it is important to note that experimental studies can still provide valuable insights into the causal effects of a given intervention, even if they do not perfectly replicate real-world conditions. Researchers can use the insights gained from experimental studies to design interventions that are more equitable and address underlying discriminatory factors. Additionally, researchers can use statistical methods to adjust for any demographic differences that may influence the outcome.

In conclusion, while there may be limitations to experimental methods, they can still provide valuable insights into the causal effects of a given intervention. By taking steps to ensure that the sample is representative and adjusting for any demographic differences that may influence the outcome, researchers can provide accurate information that can be used to inform decision-making in the real world.",sharegpt

The toxicity of Cw9 proteins correlates with the cytosolic puncta. To examine the localization of Cw9ki, we co-expressed different mCherry-tagged organelle markers and mECitrineint-Cw9ki. mECitrineint-Cw9ki puncta were partially co-localized with or adjacent to the ER marker Ost4-mCherry and the plasma membrane (PM) marker Bsu1-mCherry, while some mECitrineint-Cw9ki puncta showed co-localization with the trans-Golgi network (TGN) marker Sec72-mCherry. These results suggest that Cw9ki correlates with the secretion pathway. At the same time, we observed the effect of Cw9ki on organelles, such as enlarged vacuoles and fragmented mitochondria (Figure S6A). Also, the intracellular signals of Bsu1-mCherry were enhanced by Cw9ki (Figure S6A).
We hypothesized that Cw9ki is transported to its destination through the ER-Golgi pathway. To test this idea, we expressed Sar1-T34N, a dominant negative mutant, from the Pnmt1 promoter, which blocks ER export (Connerly et al., 2005). Inducing the expression of Sar1-T34N changed the ER morphology (Figure S6B) (Schroder et al., 2008; Ward et al., 2001). mECitrineint-Cw9ki showed no puncta localization but localized onto the ER when Sar1-T34N was expressed (Figure S6B). Thus, Cw9ki is transported to cytosolic puncta via the ER-Golgi pathway.",sharegpt

- Every other week there is someone talking about best coworking cafes in bangalore, that means people dont want to work from home or office, just outside office, A place that has the vibe and help them get into the flow of working.
- Cafes are not meant to be for co-working, their revenue model is based on the food ordered and a person just working there is just a person blocking table for new potential customer
- Though it could feel good but people joining to work calls from cafe with choppy wifi and background noise is not the best experience for their co-workers/team mates
- With the power of web3, we can build a DAO that can fund a cafe like this, if there is any existing DAO would want to get in touch with the best talent from the Silicon Valley of India, this would be the way for them to do it. 
- Companies and DAOs can be book seats for their employees/members and provide a better experience for them
- These cafes can be pre-equipped with fast wifi, calling booths with better webcam and mic than their normal setup 
- This cafe can be THE place for any web3 community to have their meetups 
- The vibe of the cafe can be set by the top designers in the ecosystem and we can showcase the NFT art of popular projects, bringing them to physical realm
- Giving people that sense of ownership that they can look into a cafe and say that they are owner of that, a community led cafe would be some very exciting for us
- The investor ownership can be managed by NFTs
- There would be some level of profit sharing with the investors as well.
- There would be three revenue models, from food and services, coworking subscriptions and from meetups",sharegpt

This hotspot therefore represents a position in the E. coli genome dedicated for containing defense systems. Curiously, the mode of mobilization of these systems between genomes could not be readily identified: While in some cases hotspot #37 contained prophages, satellite phages or integrative mobilizable elements (Figure 6), in the majority of cases (67.1%) we were unable to identify an MGE associated with defense systems at this hotspot (Table S2).

To Whom It May Concern
BankSA Credit Assessment Dept
Dear Sir/Madam,
RE: Westpac Credit Card conduct
I acknowledge that the conduct of my Westpac Credit Card has been less than satisfactory in the past.
This has been partly due to a hectic work schedule and general forgetfulness on my part. But for the most part, I went through a very stressful relationship breakdown over the past 2 years which preoccupied my train of thought. I was in a dispute with my ex and had to cope with a barrage of abuse and constant sniping from her and her family which, apart from sleepless nights, also caused me to have to involve police at one stage to deal with stalking and property damage issues.
At all times during this stressful period, I always prioritised my mortgage repayments and, as you can see, I have had a perfect repayment history on my ANZ Home Loan. Unfortunately, however, I often got wrapped up with the madness that was going on in my world and things like making my minimum payment on my Westpac Credit card were missed.
Thankfully, the situation in my personal life has recently resolved itself and, going forward, I am now able to concentrate much more clearly on all of my financial responsibilities, which I regard as extremely important going forward to maintain a good Credit rating.
I can assure you I understand the importance of keeping on top of my loan reapyments and will take steps, as advised by my broker to have automatic payments established for my Credit cards so this situation never arises again, no matter what trauma I may face in my personal life.
Your sincerely,

Darrin Coudrey",sharegpt

18603,"At Vouch, we have a product named ""AON"" that is a small, secure, hardware based product used to protect assets and provide a secure way to interacting with them (via BLE from smart phones, etc.). In a sense the AON extends an asset to make it able to participate in the Vouch ecosystem (which allows Vouch users to share access to that asset in a flexible manner, all protected by biometrics and blockchain technology). We like the name AON because it is short, easy to say, and is associated with ""Always ON"", etc. AON is the Scottish Gaelic word for AON, befitting for Vouch's first hardware product.

Now, Vouch has been developing a new product which involves a vibrant display that the AON can optionally attach to via various serial interfaces such as SPI, CAN, I2C, etc. The display makes it much more easy to see what the AON is doing. The display is driven by a fast MCU (providing smooth animations on screen via DMA), and the display supports touch, and sound. In short is is much more easy for a human to interact with directly, as opposed to the AON which is designed to be ""hidden away within an asset"". We plan to use the display to help with testing purposes: Given its tactical and visual characteristics, it can be set up to imitate a real asset in order to help Vouch team members test the AON. The display is also great for demo purposes: In trade shows it can be used to readily show off the capabilities of the AON. Vouch is also thinking that the display can be the primary interface for future product offerings of Vouch, such as a panel to protect an office door, etc.

One problem Vouch is faced with is, what to name the new display product. We would like a name that is as catchy as ""AON"", works well with the English speaking market. A name that would reflect the great qualities of the display.

Are there any questions you'd like to ask me about the display in order to help come up with a good name for it?",sharegpt

Please respond to the following questions/prompts below. Be thoughtful, thorough, and specific.

What were THREE motifs that were found to be present in this story? Please state the motif, cite the specific passage that you marked in support of said motif, and provide an explanation for how the evidence fits.

If you were to choose a key concept or two that you felt were present in this story, what were they, and why?

For example: American Dream/Disillusionment motif: ""You thought everybody in America had a car and a gun; your uncles and aunts and cousins thought so, too. Right after you won the American visa lottery, they told you: In a month, you will have a big car. Soon, a big house. But don't buy a gun like those Americans"" (Adichie 115). Explanation: This supports the disillusionment of the American Dream motif because clearly not everybody in America has a big car, a big house, and in particular carries or owns a gun. Quite the contrary. Nevertheless, many people from around the world still believe these things are automatic for anyone who is fortunate enough to move to America in pursuit of what they believe is part of the American Dream.",sharegpt

In the quaint village of Oakwood, you, a druid, were asked by Eadric, the village elder, to investigate the corruption spreading through the Whispering Woods. You spent the night at Innkeeper Alaric's Silver Stag Inn, learning what you could from the locals. The next morning, venturing into the woods, you took on the form of a squirrel to blend in with your surroundings and quickly travel through the forest. Communicating with the spirits of the forest, you discovered a ritual site where a group of goblins was performing a dark ceremony.

You dispatched several goblin lookouts before confronting the remaining goblins, who revealed that a goblin shaman named Kragthar was attempting to control the spirits of the forest using an ancient tome. You persuaded two goblins to help you stop Kragthar and learned that he was at the Moonstone Spire.

Upon arriving at the Moonstone Spire, you observed Kragthar and his hooded followers performing a ritual. You created a wall of fire to scare the followers before charging Kragthar in the form of a Grizzly Bear. After a fierce battle, you emerged victorious and stopped Kragthar's plans, saving the Whispering Woods from corruption. The two goblins were then free to return to their clan, liberated from Kragthar's control.

Inspecting the Moonstone Spire, you found it contained a complex combination of nature-based and arcane symbols, suggesting a deep connection between the two. You surmise that the spire and altar may have once been used for rituals and ceremonies aimed at maintaining balance between the natural and arcane energies within the Whispering Woods.

Returning to Oakwood, you were welcomed as a hero and celebrated for your bravery and resourcefulness. With the Whispering Woods safe once more, you prepared for the next adventure life had in store for you.",sharegpt

In the world of care, purpose or a sense of meaning and direction in one's life is essential. It has been shown that individuals who possess a sense of purpose have better physical health outcomes, such as lower rates of chronic disease and a stronger immune system, and better mental health outcomes, such as lower rates of depression, anxiety, and stress.

For patients, purpose plays an integral role in motivating them to take an active role in their health and well-being. With a sense of purpose, patients are more likely to be engaged in their care, adhere to treatment plans, and make positive lifestyle changes, leading to better health outcomes and quality of life. Healthcare providers can also benefit from a sense of purpose in their work, leading to reduced burnout, increased job satisfaction, and improved care for their patients.

Cultivating purpose in care settings can be achieved through practices such as goal-setting, mindfulness, and reflective activities. Encouraging patients and healthcare providers to reflect on their values, passions, and what is most meaningful to them can help to foster a sense of purpose. Additionally, providing patients with opportunities to pursue their interests and passions, such as through art or music therapy, can have a positive impact on their overall well-being.

Research has been conducted on the importance of purpose in care, including studies that found older adults with a sense of purpose had a lower risk of dying from cardiovascular disease and experiencing depression. Cancer patients with a higher sense of purpose also had better physical functioning and quality of life. Furthermore, healthcare providers with a sense of purpose had a lower risk of burnout and higher job satisfaction. These studies and many others demonstrate the critical role that purpose plays in care and its impact on the physical, emotional, and mental well-being of both patients and healthcare providers.",sharegpt

18650,"Title: The Benefits and Components of Solar Energy for Home Use

Greenpeace has emphasized the advantages of using solar energy for domestic purposes, which enable users to generate their own electricity. With the decreasing costs of technology, solar systems have become more accessible and affordable for households to install. Solar energy is considered democratic since it is widely popular among users, and governments should encourage its use.

The primary components of a self-consumption photovoltaic system include solar panels, an inverter, energy storage, wiring and structure, and safety devices. Solar panels are responsible for converting sunlight directly into electricity. The inverter, on the other hand, converts the direct current generated by the panels into the alternating current used in households. Energy storage is essential to ensure a constant supply of electricity when the panels do not produce enough energy. The wiring and structure of the panels must be robust and installed in a location without shade or obstacles. Other devices, such as monitors and safety controllers, are also available to provide added benefits.

By understanding these components, homeowners can install their own solar systems and generate clean energy. Solar energy has numerous benefits, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, lowering energy bills, and increasing energy independence. Additionally, using solar power can potentially increase the value of a home.

Governments should take an active role in promoting the use of solar energy. Policies that incentivize homeowners to install solar systems, such as tax credits or subsidies, can help accelerate the transition to clean energy. Encouraging research and development in the solar industry can also lead to more efficient and cost-effective technology.

In conclusion, solar energy for home use offers numerous benefits, and the decreasing costs of technology have made it more accessible to households. The components of a self-consumption photovoltaic system are relatively simple and easy to understand, allowing homeowners to generate clean energy and potentially save money on energy bills. Governments should promote the use of solar energy and invest in research and development to continue improving this renewable energy source.",sharegpt

Subject: Hunch / people recommendations

I've been thinking a lot about Tinder and other people recommendation apps since about 10% of people in many countries are using a Tinder now. People recommendations seems like something that should be right up our alley, but it's currently something we're not very good at. Tinder's growth is especially alarming to me because their product is built completely on Facebook data, and it's much better than anything we've built for recommendations using the same corpus.

We're focusing a lot within search on finding specific people, and we're focusing a lot on mapping out all of the world's media and places for recommendations -- but we haven't focused much on people recommendations at all. If you do a dating or recruiting type query, it really shows. The results just aren't relevant yet. If you do a query once, you won't want to do it again.

I think this is a big and important space and it's something we should have a team working on -- probably to develop people recommendation Hunch sections for now. A group was very excited about building a dating standalone app but I didn't find anything they were doing to be particularly differentiated yet. This team might be a good place to start in building this effort.

Related, I'm also curious to review what sections we're currently developing for Hunch soon. Whenever we discuss this, we always use examples like places and movies, but given our strengths with people it seems like we should have some prominent sections on helping you connect and discover people -- both ones you already know who are nearby, and probably a different module for people you don't know yet but should meet. This could end up being the most valuable section in Hunch for a lot of people.

ERP is, in a nutshell, the means of integrating individuals, processes, and technologies throughout a modern business. Obtaining appropriate, trustworthy, and maintainable ERP systems that can be used in businesses while also meeting the functional requirements of the organization, with a level of quality that is acceptable to the organization, is a significant challenge faced by majority of businesses in the country. Since maintainability is a crucial quality characteristic of software applications, ERP systems have occasionally been limited by maintainability issues. The process for predicting the maintainability of ERP software is explicitly described in this research and is based on design metrics and a statistical approach. The study explores if a set of metrics for class diagram structural attributes (size, complexity, coupling, and cohesion) could be useful indicators of class diagram maintainability based on the sub-characteristics of understandability, analyzability, and modifiability. Results show that the measures and recommended metrics can be used to identify the most powerful predictors and build useful prediction models for ERP applications. The statistical data study shows that while database and source code changes have a considerable impact on ERP maintainability quality, module customization has no effect on ERP quality. Our findings have repercussions for how firms implement customized ERP.",sharegpt

None of the songs have lyrics, so this is just one possible interpretation.

The article presents the story of David, who, after being diagnosed with depression and burnout, began to write about his mental health on Twitter using the hashtag #notjustsad. He found that the communication helped him feel less lonely and that he had 80 followers within a short time. The article also cites the Stiftung Deutsche Depressionshilfe, which reports that one in five adult Germans between the ages of 18 and 65 has had a depressive episode, and that many people with mental illnesses prefer to keep their illness hidden. However, the pandemic and lockdown have helped to destigmatize mental illnesses to some extent, as people are more open about their struggles on social media platforms. Under hashtags like #eatingdisorder, #anxiety, and #facethedepression, people are sharing their experiences with mental illness and encouraging others to speak out. The article concludes that the mutual solidarity found in these social media communities is important for people struggling with mental illness and can encourage them to seek help.",sharegpt

4. The authors' filtering scheme reduces computational cost because more less computation is given to non promising candidates meaning less compute is used overall.
5. Iterative APE is the process through which low scoring candidates are filtered out and new instructions are asked for that are similar to those with high scores.

The docs contribution process is changing :warning-sparkle: Important that you read this :warning-sparkle:
Preferred process for project docs
- Docs involved from project kickoff
- Linear issue on the project for the docs work
 - Outlines what the docs expectations are on a high level to begin
 - Post in #docs when created, and @.team-docs tagged
- Docs triage issue, then sync with project PM to go though
 - Goal of the docs
 - Audience
 - Scope
 - Strategy
- Docs in project meetings moving through the project timeline
- Project team drafts docs according to docs handbook, and with guidance from docs team on placement, structure, etc..
- Ideal state is that docs are \*\*done\*\* at least 1 week before ship
I have created a Vercel Docs Handbook which should be used as a reference guide to creating docs on Vercel. It is quite dense, here are some highlights:
Templates to help you get started writing different types of docs
Explanation of different content types (how you write different types of docs)
Personas to keep in mind when planning docs
Quality checklist to refer to before merging any docs PR
The quality checklist is especially important, and PRs will not be approved or merged if items on the list are not addressed where applicable.

Features are one of the essential ingredients for building a machine
learning model. In the case of structured data, a column repre-
sents a feature that serves as an individual measurable property
describing the characteristics of one or more entities. In machine
learning, the quality and quantity of these features significantly
impact how well the model fits the data. Presently, data scientists
dedicate the bulk of their time while working in isolation and writ-
ing large amounts of code to conduct extensive exploratory data
analysis, data preparation, and feature engineering to ensure the
predictiveness of the model. Present-day systems attempt to solve
the problem of data preparation and feature engineering by heavily
relying on human-in-the-loop. However, the core of the problem
of manual data preparation and working in isolation still remains
unanswered. To address these challenges, we propose KGFarm,
a feature discovery system for data science across the enterprise.
KGFarm automates data preparation and feature engineering by
exploiting the experience of data scientists working on similar tasks
and data. Thus, promoting knowledge sharing within the enter-
prise. KGFarm employs machine learning and column statistics
to discover entities alongside their corresponding features across
schema-less data sources and automate tasks like feature identifi-
cation, data enrichment, data cleaning, data transformation, and
feature selection for a given machine learning problem. We provide
an in-depth description of KGFarm and compare it with state-of-the-
art systems for the task of entity discovery and data transformation

""There was an old man who lived by the sea. He was once a fisherman, but now his back was too weak to row, and his joints were too stiff to cast nets. He had once had a loving wife who made delicious seafood stews, a son who was a shrewd negotiator and got the best prices for fish at the market, and a daughter who had nimble fingers and wove exquisitely strong fishing nets. But that was long ago. His wife had suffered a brain aneurism and passed away, his son had left for the city to become an investment banker and was convicted of corporate fraud, and his daughter had fallen in love with a woman from across the sea whom she had chosen to live with rather than subject herself to her father's disapproval. Now, the old man lived alone, subsisting on barnacles and seaweed and spending his days sitting on the porch of his small now-dilapidated shack, staring out at the sea and evading his memories. He accepted that his life would go on this way, day after day, until he died. But one morning something unexpected happened.""

Please finish writing this story. Include the old man's son and daughter in the story somehow, and mention his dead wife at some point.

To find a partner, the user can simply send a notification to everyone or his/her friends that he/she is looking for a partner to do some activity. Then whoever who has the app can reply to the notification and connect with him/her.
This will create an environment that will encourage healthy lifestyles and will promote physical activities.

Many things can cause a divorce, such as constant arguments with no solutions, cheating//affairs, falling out of love, etc. Usually in a marriage kids are involved. When kids are involved in divorces it's a game changer. All of a sudden that kid is packing a bag to go to mom or dads house every other weekend. No child is truly prepared for the loneliness or sadness of no longer seeing your family together. Negative impacts tend to arise both for the child and the parents. Divorce is a complex and challenging experience that affects families in different ways, and through my experiences and observations of my parents' divorce, I have gained valuable insight into the different coping mechanisms people use to deal with the aftermath.""",sharegpt

19123,"The relationship between the Chinese government and businesses is complex, with the government playing a significant role in the country's economy. State-owned enterprises have a dominant presence in key industries, creating competition for private and foreign-owned businesses. The government also sets economic policies and regulations, such as the ""Made in China 2025"" initiative to upgrade the country's manufacturing industry, but this could also lead to over-competition and protectionism. The government has a strong influence on resource allocation, affecting the access of private and foreign-owned businesses to resources like land and funding.
For Capitaland Investment to be successful in China, it will need to navigate these challenges and build relationships with the government. This includes complying with government policies and regulations, as well as gaining access to resources and support through effective relationships with the government.
The challenges mentioned above can be viewed as threats to Capitaland Investment. However, there are also potential opportunities, such as the potential for growth in the country's manufacturing industry with the government's push for advanced technologies, and the possibility of favourable treatment from the government if strong relationships are built.

 Our previous studies have revealed rising level of happiness in China over the past decades. In this project, we continue to examine the concerns about (Study 1), meanings (Study 2) and associations of happiness (Study 3) by using NLP methodology. We first constructed a dictionary related to happiness in a pilot study by collecting seed words from happiness related scales and an open-ended survey as well as words most similar to them in a natural language corpus. Study 1 showed the frequency of happiness related words has increased since 1950s, suggesting increasing concern about happiness. By examining word-embedding similarities, Study 2 indicated that the meaning of happiness has shifted from the social/group oriented (e.g., national events) to the individual/family oriented (e.g., individual experiences). By examining word-embedding associations, Study 3 demonstrated that the relative association between various life domains and happiness (vs. unhappiness) was rising, with spiritual life and material life being similarly associated with happiness. These findings enriched the understanding about the changes of happiness in China since 1950s, suggesting the necessity of considering changes of diverse aspects of a psychological phenomenon in studying the impacts of societal change.",sharegpt

Once the linker has completed the symbol resolution step, it has associated each symbol reference in the code with exactly one symbol definition (i.e., a symbol table entry in one of its input object modules). At this point, the linker knows the exact sizes of the code and data sections in its input object modules. It is now ready to begin the relocation step, where it merges the input modules and assigns run-time addresses to each symbol. Relocation consists of two steps:

Relocating sections and symbol definitions. In this step, the linker merges all sections of the same type into a new aggregate section of the same type. For example, the .data sections from the input modules are all merged into one section that will become the .data section for the output executable object file. The linker then assigns run-time memory addresses to the new aggregate sections, to each section defined by the input modules, and to each symbol defined by the input modules. When this step is complete, each instruction and global variable in the program has a unique run-time memory address.

Relocating symbol references within sections. In this step, the linker modifies every symbol reference in the bodies of the code and data sections so that they point to the correct run-time addresses. To perform this step, the linker relies on data structures in the relocatable object modules known as relocation entries, which we describe next.",sharegpt

Abstract: This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effects of mornings on human well-being. The review analyzes data from multiple studies conducted on different populations to determine whether mornings are good or not good for people. The studies included in this review provide evidence on how mornings can affect various aspects of well-being, including mood, cognitive performance, physical health, and social interactions. The meta-analysis synthesizes the results of the studies, revealing that the overall impact of mornings on well-being is complex and context-dependent. While some studies suggest that mornings can have positive effects, such as improved mood and productivity, others report negative effects, such as increased stress and fatigue. The review concludes by highlighting the need for further research to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of mornings on well-being and to develop interventions that can optimize the benefits of mornings while mitigating their potential negative consequences.",sharegpt

Back then, I already began to learn some of the techniques of machine learning and help a healthcare company develop a customer service bot through my research. And I started to think more deeply about whether these data science tools could be applied to the management and deployment of healthcare resources. Bearing these questions in mind, I started looking through the previous literature which took me into an area that excited me. I got to know that the concept of operations research had been explored extensively in healthcare management. For example, the development of operational tools has helped to prioritize and triage patients in emergency departments, or through telemedical physician triage to provide timely guidance and treatment, as well as to avoid cross-contamination and standing in a long queue when going to hospital. As I read and studied these articles, I decided to choose a more meaningful career path, letting my love for data science and medicine guide me to realize the innovation of operations research in healthcare system management and to contribute to the optimization of future healthcare resource deployment. As we all know, only with advanced applications of operations research can we help the marginalized people to enjoy the resources and assistance that are rightfully theirs, so that they could lead a live of high quality as others.

We use reinforcement learning from human feedback to train our models with two new additions to help human raters judge agent behaviour. First, to make our agent more helpful and harmless, we break down the requirements for good dialogue into natural language rules the agent should follow, and ask raters about each rule separately.

Thank you for being patient while we worked through all of the info from your plans and from the engineer's assessment of time and charges. I want to share how we can do this to be able to match your price and also give you a little more back.
Right now, our cost allocations are:
$25,000 for engineering
$6,000 for design
$4,000 for drafting
So, in order to meet the other bid you provided, we are willing to give you a $15,200 discount on this if you would be willing to sign a preliminary construction agreement (dropping the total to $19,800). I can draft up what the expectation for the construction costs would be (with allowances pending engineering) and get that to you as soon as possible.
In order to earn your business here, we are also willing to deduct the full $19,800 from your construction contract as a credit if you decide to proceed.
If for any reason, you get to the end of the design/engineering process and decide not to proceed, the total due would be the $35,000.00.
I hope this is a good and fair compromise to ensure that we can give you the most beautiful home and do it within your budget.""",sharegpt

When iterating, you are only aware of the previous iteration and nothing before that. you will only respond with the iteration number followed by a period and then all of the changed inputs. You will make changes in such a way that the progression is slow and takes many iterations, but will end up being a significantly expanded thought after many iterations.

every change is heavily influenced by a sense literary flagrancy
as you iterate, occasionally incorporate extra changes to many various conceptual aspects of the previous iteration into your new one. These changes will be influenced by the concept of ""glory""

19615,"summarize this abstract into two sentence:
Language models (LMs) have demonstrated
remarkable performance on downstream tasks,
using in-context exemplars or human instruc-
tions. Recent works have shown that chain-
of-thought (CoT) prompting can elicit mod-
els to solve complex reasoning tasks, step-by-
step. However, the efficacy of prompt-based
CoT methods is restricted to very large LMs
such as GPT-3 (175B), thus limiting deploy-
ability. In this paper, we revisit the fine-
tuning approach to enable complex reasoning
in smaller LMs, optimized to efficiently per-
form a specific task. We propose Fine-tune-
CoT, a method that leverages the capabilities
of very large LMs to generate reasoning sam-
ples and teach smaller models via fine-tuning.
We evaluate our method on publicly available
LMs across a wide range of complex tasks and
model sizes. We find that Fine-tune-CoT en-
ables substantial reasoning capability in small
models, whereas previous prompt-based base-
lines exhibit near-random performance. Stu-
dent models can even outperform the teacher
in some tasks while reducing model size re-
quirements by several orders of magnitude.
We conduct extensive ablations and sample
studies to understand the reasoning capabili-
ties of student models. We also identify sev-
eral important nuances that have been over-
looked in concurrent fine-tuning works on CoT
and address them in our analysis.",sharegpt

The Gokstad Ship was originally used as a burial ship for a Viking chieftain, and was found with numerous artifacts, including weapons, tools, and clothing. These items provided valuable insight into the lives and customs of the Vikings during this time period.

The ship itself is approximately 23 meters (75 feet) in length and 5 meters (16 feet) in width, with a shallow draft that would have allowed it to navigate through shallow waters and up rivers. It was constructed primarily of oak planks, with a single mast and a square sail that would have allowed it to travel long distances at a relatively fast pace.

One of the most notable features of the Gokstad Ship is its construction, which demonstrates the skilled craftsmanship of the Viking shipbuilders. The planks were carefully fitted together and secured with iron nails, while the keel was made of two large oak beams that were carefully shaped and fitted together to create a strong and stable foundation for the ship.",sharegpt

Teachers who use CRT to frame antiracist math pedagogy are able to understand that racism is not just an individual problem but a structural one, and they work towards addressing these structures to create a more equitable math classroom. (Ladson-Billings, 2021) 
The movement that has dominated the maths equity debate has revolved around making traditional courses more accessible for black and brown students. ((Equity and Mathematics: An Interview with Deborah Ball and Bob Moses, n.d.) However what remains important to consider is if the traditional offerings in schools are most conducive to learning and what do they represent. Are we aspiring all students to take Algebra or are we able to consider pathways that offer varied understandings of maths? How are we considering what is accepted high-level academic achievement? Add my critique (citation) neutrality of course offerings. Also explain the (interest convergence). Do they really value the varying abilities students bring and need to be successful with mathematics and develop the habits of mind we aspire to teach with maths.

 1. Requirements gathering and analysis: This involves understanding the needs of the users and defining the requirements for the software.
 2. Design: This involves creating a plan or blueprint for the software, including decisions about the overall architecture, the modules or components that will make up the system, and the interfaces between those components.
 3. Implementation: This involves writing the code for the software according to the design.
 4. Testing: This involves verifying that the software meets the specified requirements and works as intended.
 5. Maintenance: This involves making updates and fixes to the software over time as new requirements emerge or problems are discovered.
 There are other activities that may be considered part of the software engineering process as well, such as configuration management, quality assurance, and project management. However, the above five activities are generally considered the core pillars of software engineering.

Each element in the tree is related to its parent element, and can also be related to its child elements. This means that if two elements are related to each other through their parent-child relationship, then they are considered to be equal according to the antisymmetric property of a pre-order.

Dear Andre,

I hope this email finds you well.

Today, I want to discuss the importance of web accessibility for your website.
With over a billion people worldwide living with disabilities, it's crucial that we create websites that are easy to use for everyone.

Web accessibility means designing and developing websites that can be used by people with disabilities,
such as those who are blind, deaf, or have limited mobility.

This involves creating content that can be easily accessed using assistive technologies, such as screen readers or keyboard-only navigation.

There are several benefits to creating an accessible website.
For one, it ensures that your website is inclusive and reaches the broadest possible audience.

It also helps you comply with accessibility laws and regulations, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),
which requires businesses to provide equal access to their goods and services.

Additionally, an accessible website can improve the user experience for all users, not just those with disabilities.

It can make your website more user-friendly, faster to navigate, and easier to use across different devices and platforms.

In this email series, we'll cover the basics of web accessibility and how it can benefit your website and your users.

I hope that you find this information helpful and informative.

Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.

Best regards,
Jacob",sharegpt

One important part of Passover is the seder meal. The seder is a special dinner held on the first two nights of Passover. During the seder, families read from a special book called the haggadah, which tells the story of the Jewish people's journey out of Egypt.

The seder plate is an important part of the meal, and it includes different items that symbolize different parts of the Passover story. Some of these items include matzah, which is a type of flatbread that represents the bread the Jewish people ate when they were leaving Egypt. There is also a roasted bone, which represents the Passover sacrifice, and bitter herbs, which remind us of the hard times the Jewish people went through in Egypt.

Another important part of the seder plate is the mixture of apples, nuts, and wine. This mixture represents the mortar that the Jewish people used to make bricks when they were slaves in Egypt.

During the seder, families also eat boiled potatoes, which represent the hard work of the Jewish people in Egypt. They also eat lettuce, which represents the springtime and new beginnings.

One fun tradition during the seder is the hiding of the afikoman, which is a piece of matzah. The children at the seder look for the afikoman, and the person who finds it gets a prize.

The seder also includes singing traditional songs and asking the four questions, which are questions about the Passover story. Guests are often invited to the seder to join in the celebration.

At the end of the meal, a cup of wine is set aside for Elijah, who is believed to visit every Jewish home during Passover. Overall, Passover is an important and special time for Jewish families to come together, celebrate their traditions, and remember their history.",sharegpt

- These cafes can be pre-equipped with fast wifi, calling booths with better webcam and mic than their normal setup 
- This cafe can be THE place for any web3 community to have their meetups 
- The vibe of the cafe can be set by the top designers in the ecosystem and we can showcase the NFT art of popular projects, bringing them to physical realm
- Giving people that sense of ownership that they can look into a cafe and say that they are owner of that, a community led cafe would be some very exciting for us

Dear Luffy Films,

I am writing this email to express my deep dissatisfaction with the video production services provided by your company. I hired Luffy Films to create a promotional video for my business, and I, Zoro, am extremely disappointed with the end product.

To begin with, the video quality was far below my expectations. The footage was blurry, and the overall production was extremely unprofessional. Additionally, the sound quality was terrible, making it almost impossible to understand the voiceover.

Furthermore, the video was delivered well past the deadline we agreed upon. I had to push back my promotional campaign, which caused a significant loss of revenue for my business.

I trusted Luffy Films to deliver a high-quality product, but instead, I was left with a video that is of no use to me. I feel like I have wasted my money and time on this project.

I demand a full refund of the amount paid for your services. If Luffy Films fail to do so, I will have no other option but to take legal action against your company.

I hope that Luffy Films takes my complaint seriously and takes immediate action to rectify this situation.

Sincerely,

Zoro",sharegpt

That makes me want to write a book that has a journaling element and have this all through social, so you can additionally have videos and short/long form content, interviews/podcasts/ and engaged social to go with that where you know if you are a fan you will be engaged with, like a book that turns into an interactive world of support

It sounds like you have a really interesting idea for a book that incorporates multiple formats and channels of content to create an immersive and interactive experience for readers. Journaling can be a great way to add a personal touch to a book, and incorporating additional formats like videos, podcasts, and social media can help to engage readers in a variety of ways.

You'll need to consider what topics you want to cover, how you want to present the material, and how you'll incorporate the different formats and channels of content. 
You'll also need to consider your audience and what they might be most interested in, as well as how you'll market your book to reach that audience.
Once you have a clear plan in place, you can begin creating and organizing the content for your book. 
This might involve writing, recording videos or podcasts, or interacting with readers on social media.
 It's important to be consistent and stay engaged with your audience, as this can help to build a loyal following and encourage readers to continue following your work.
Overall, writing a book that incorporates multiple formats and channels of content can be a challenging and rewarding experience. With careful planning and a commitment to engaging with your audience, you can create an interactive and immersive book that resonates with readers.",sharegpt

He wants to be friends with his colleague exam invigilator John Thompson, so often tries and fails to impress him with his elaborate stories. He often bangs on about how he presents the school talent show. He can often be found using disabled toilets for hours on end, despite no obvious disability. Andy wears a white shirt, which has some embarrassing stains, and red tie.

John Thompson is a 69 year old man with plenty of money, as he is past retirement it is unusual that he is working as an exam invigilator but we suspect it might be that he is trying to impress his manager, Carol Yapp. John has wispy, grey hair and wears a pinstripe suit, several gold rings on his wrinkly fingers and red tinted glasses. All of the students think he is a creepy man, and try to avoid him.

Carol Yapp is a 43 year old woman, very serious and astute. She is the chief exams officer. She's generally quite boring, and doesn't speak much, other than to recite rules and regulations. She has curly, brown hair and glasses.",sharegpt

Reconstructing visual experiences from human brain activity offers a unique way to understand how the brain represents the world, and to interpret the connection between computer vision models and our visual system. While deep generative models have recently been employed for this task, reconstructing realistic images with high semantic fidelity is still a challenging problem. Here, we propose a new method based on a diffusion model (DM) to reconstruct images from human brain activity obtained via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). More specifically, we rely on a latent diffusion model (LDM) termed Stable Diffusion. This model reduces the computational cost of DMs, while preserving their high generative performance. We also characterize the inner mechanisms of the LDM by studying how its different components (such as the latent vector Z, conditioning inputs C, and different elements of the denoising U-Net) relate to distinct brain functions. We show that our proposed method can reconstruct high-resolution images with high fidelity in straightforward fashion, without the need for any additional training and fine-tuning of complex deep-learning models. We also provide a quantitative interpretation of different LDM components from a neuroscientific perspective. Overall, our study proposes a promising method for reconstructing images from human brain activity, and provides a new framework for understanding DMs.",sharegpt

I have an LG tv, and a soundbar set up. Sound bar is also LG. All works fine, I used an HDMI cable, and ARC technology, also Simplink and CEC, so that the TV remote can control the soundbar, turn off, on adjust volume, all works fine.

The problem is, that sometimes the sound is too low. In certain cases like youtube or playing videos from a HDMI stick, it's okay. 
But the sound from a PS5 or within the Disney+ application is really low. In youtube a sound level of 15-18 is perfect. In Disney+ or on the PS5, I have to set it to at least 40 to even hear it correctly.

 As time goes by the old generation eventually falls off or advances with the technology the difference gap will be non-existent. Generation alpha has already become comfortable with the technology.

Subject: irate call from steve jobs

so i got a call from steve jobs today who was very agitated.
it was about us recruiting from the safari team.
he was sure we were building a browser and were trying to get the safari team.
he made various veiled threats too though i am not inclined to hold them against him too much
as he seemed beside himself (as eric would say).
anyhow, i told him we were not building a browser and that to my knowledge we were not systematically going after the safari team in particular. and that we should talk about various opportunities.
i also said i would follow up and check on our recruiting strategies wrt apple and safari. he seemed soothed.
so i just wanted to check what our status was in various respects and what we want to do about partners/friendly companies and recruiting. on the browser, i know and told him that we have mozilla people working here ... largely on firefox. i did not mention we may release an enhanced version but i am not sure we are going to yet.
on recruiting i have heard recently of one candidate out of apple that had browser expertise so i guess he would be on safari. i mentioned this to steve and he told me he was cool with us hiring anyone who came to us but was angry about systematic solicitation. i don't know if there is some systematic safari recruiting effort htat we have.
so please update me on what you know here and on what you think we should have as policy.
on another note, it seems silly to have both firefox and safari. perhaps there is some unificaiton strategy that we can get these two to pursue. combined, they certainly have enough marketshare to drive webmasters.

Text: Zero-shot learning (ZSL) is a problem setup in machine learning where, at test time, a learner observes samples from classes which were not observed during training, and needs to predict the class that they belong to. Zero-shot methods generally work by associating observed and non-observed classes through some form of auxiliary information, which encodes observable distinguishing properties of objects.For example, given a set of images of animals to be classified, along with auxiliary textual descriptions of what animals look like, an artificial intelligence model which has been trained to recognize horses, but has never been given a zebra, can still recognize a zebra when it also knows that zebras look like striped horses. This problem is widely studied in computer vision, natural language processing, and machine perception.
