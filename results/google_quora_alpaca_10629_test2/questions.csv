818,"Create a short, concise summary of the paper based on its abstract.

Few-shot learning (FSL) is one of the key future steps in machine learning and raises a lot of attention. In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance."

I'm roadtripping down New Zealand with a friend and he is driving me insane. He hasn't enjoyed all the tours we've been on and doesn't want to chat about ANYTHING. We're a week into our trip and this is the quietest I've ever been when hanging out with another person as he rebuffs all my attempts at conversation. He wears his airpods in the car and around the accommodation - not that I've kept trying to talk to him. Honestly, he is bringing some seriously bad vibes to everything and it's ruining my trip.
We don't have anything booked in yet for the South Island, so I'm planning to ditch him in Wellington at the ferry. Probably book my own car in Picton and just relax alone for the rest of the trip. (Just thinking about it is such sharp relief that it makes me feel emotional. I'll pay whatever price I have to just to get away from him.)
Obviously telling him he is ruining my trip with his negative energy isn't the best way to approach this.

1997,"Summarize the article you have been given in a brief manner.

Mathematics and art are related in a variety of ways. Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.
Mathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting."

Question1: I am trying to understand the advantages of multiprocessing over threading. I know that multiprocessing gets around the Global Interpreter Lock, but what other advantages are there, and can threading not do the same thing?
Question2: I am learning how to use the threading and the multiprocessing modules in Python to run certain operations in parallel and speed up my code.
I am finding this hard (maybe because I don't have any theoretical background about it) to understand what the difference is between a threading.Thread() object and a multiprocessing.Process() one.
Also, it is not entirely clear to me how to instantiate a queue of jobs and having only 4 (for example) of them running in parallel, while the other wait for resources to free before being executed.
I find the examples in the documentation clear, but not very exhaustive; as soon as I try to complicate things a bit, I receive a lot of weird errors (like a method that can't be pickled, and so on).
So, when should I use the threading and multiprocessing modules?
Can you link me to some resources that explain the concepts behind these two modules and how to use them properly for complex tasks?"

We present a state-of-the-art speech recognition system developed using end-to-end deep learning. Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a ""phoneme."" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set. Deep Speech also handles challenging noisy environments better than widely used, state-of-the-art commercial speech systems.Collapse"
