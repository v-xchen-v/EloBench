In the past, she has tried Claritin, and Zyrtec. Both worked for short time but then seemed to lose effectiveness. She has used Allegra also. She used that last summer and she began using it again two weeks ago. It does not appear to be working very well. She has used over-the-counter sprays but no prescription nasal sprays. She does have asthma but doest not require daily medication for this and does not think it is flaring up. 
MEDICATIONS: Her only medication currently is Ortho Tri-Cyclen and the Allegra. 
ALLERGIES: She has no known medicine allergies. 
OBJECTIVE: Vitals: Weight was 130 pounds and blood pressure 124/78. 
HEENT: Her throat was mildly erythematous without exudate. Nasal mucosa was erythematous and swollen. Only clear drainage was seen. TMs were clear. Neck: Supple without adenopathy. Lungs: Clear. 
ASSESSMENT: Allergic rhinitis. 
PLAN: 1. She will try Zyrtec instead of Allegra again. Another option will be to use loratadine. She does not think she has prescription coverage so that might be cheaper.2.

230,"Of the 20 available cars for rent, 12 are automatic cars, 4 are manual cars, and the rest are semi-automatic. What percentage of the cars are semi-automatic? Think step by step.
To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Let's start by finding the total number of cars:

12 automatic cars + 4 manual cars + x semi-automatic cars = 20 cars
We know that x is the number of semi-automatic cars.

12 + 4 + x = 20
We can simplify this equation by adding 4 to both sides:

16 + x = 24
We can then solve for x by subtracting 16 from both sides:

x = 24 - 16
x = 8
So there are 8 semi-automatic cars out of the 20 available cars for rent.

To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide

An emem is an idea with self-censoring properties which is actively difficult to discover or propagate.

Some ideas can be sort of said the emems in general because they are complex and incompressible or otherwise physically difficult to store. But many are specifically hard for humans to track.

This is true of many mundane ideas which are simply boring or unimportant. Others are actively unintuitive. For example, the fact that large language models are not conscious or agentic is difficult to recall or convey in face of their ability to pass the Turing Test and the number of calories in the average loaf of bread is difficult to make common knowledge because noone cares.

But also humans exist in a memetic hellscape which is exerting optimization pressure on them which influences which beliefs people tend to hold.

Viral Immunity through Codon Optimization:
 A Comparative Analysis of Genomic and Viral Data

Ishika R. Nelaturu
 The aim of my study was to identify an optimal codon that could be re-purposed as a stop codon to interrupt viral DNA and prevent the spread of viruses. To achieve this, my study assumed the possibility of codon reassignment, a process that takes advantage of codon degeneracy to create non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) that could be used in future biological medicines. 

 Using Python3 with BioPython module, analyzed the genomic data of 20,029 protein coding genes from the human reference genome GRCH38.p14 and processed approximately 138,200 protein coding sequences (CDS) to collect codon frequency data. Additionally, the study analyzed ~14,820 published viral genomes and collected codon frequency data from approximately ~587,923 protein CDS of viruses.

 The study compared the codon frequency data and identified codons that have more alternates as potential candidates for re-purposing. My analysis found that the codon GGT was used relatively less in the human genome (1,025,541 times) and had three alternates. This codon was used 3,205,148 times in virus genomes, making it a promising candidate for re-purposing as a stop codon. 

 In conclusion, this study identified potential codon that could be re-purposed as stop codons to interrupt viral DNA and prevent the spread of viruses. These findings could have significant implications for the development of future biological medicines.",lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5,gpt-4-turbo

Bacterial transcriptome profile in the presence of plant fluid or extracts during microbe growth could provide relevant information about the process of plant-bacteria interaction. RNA-Seq was used to identify the transcriptomic profile of early response from H. seropedicae strain HRC54 to sugarcane apoplastic fluid. The differential expressed genes (DEGs) analyses were carried out using DESeq2 and edgeR packages, followed by functional annotation by Blast2GO and gene ontology with COG and KEGG databases. After two hours of adding the sugarcane apoplastic fluid to a H. seropedicae HRC54 culture, the expression profile showed that 44 genes were up-regulated and 45 down-regulated. These genes are involved to bacterial metabolism, such as proteins related to oxidoreductase and transferases process, ABC transporter, motility, secretion system and signal transduction. The RNA-Seq expression pattern was also of verified by RT-qPCR using 12 genes identified in the data analyses. Results suggested that H. seropedicae HRC54 could be recognizing the sugarcane apoplastic fluid as a host signal and some of the DEGs can be strongly related the early stages of the of the establishment necessary for plant-bacteria interaction process.",gpt-4-turbo,lmsys/vicuna-13b-v1.5

607,"Write three types of activities for this text (matching, fill in the blanks and open questions): Passover is a special holiday celebrated by Jewish people every year. During Passover, families come together to celebrate and remember their history and traditions.

One important part of Passover is the seder meal. The seder is a special dinner held on the first two nights of Passover. During the seder, families read from a special book called the haggadah, which tells the story of the Jewish people's journey out of Egypt.

The seder plate is an important part of the meal, and it includes different items that symbolize different parts of the Passover story. Some of these items include matzah, which is a type of flatbread that represents the bread the Jewish people ate when they were leaving Egypt. There is also a roasted bone, which represents the Passover sacrifice, and bitter herbs, which remind us of the hard times the Jewish people went through in Egypt.

Another important part of the seder plate is the mixture of apples, nuts, and wine. This mixture represents the mortar that the Jewish people used to make bricks when they were slaves in Egypt.

During the seder, families also eat boiled potatoes, which represent the hard work of the Jewish people in Egypt. They also eat lettuce, which represents the springtime and new beginnings.

One fun tradition during the seder is the hiding of the afikoman, which is a piece of matzah. The children at the seder look for the afikoman, and the person who finds it gets a prize.

The seder also includes singing traditional songs and asking the four questions, which are questions about the Passover story. Guests are often invited to the seder to join in the celebration.

At the end of the meal, a cup of wine is set aside for Elijah, who is believed to visit every Jewish home during Passover. Overall, Passover is an important and special time for Jewish families to come together, celebrate their traditions, and remember their history.",gpt-4-turbo,lmsys/vicuna-33b-v1.3

He had once had a loving wife who made delicious seafood stews, a son who was a shrewd negotiator and got the best prices for fish at the market, and a daughter who had nimble fingers and wove exquisitely strong fishing nets. But that was long ago. His wife had suffered a brain aneurism and passed away, his son had left for the city to become an investment banker and was convicted of corporate fraud, and his daughter had fallen in love with a woman from across the sea whom she had chosen to live with rather than subject herself to her father's disapproval. Now, the old man lived alone, subsisting on barnacles and seaweed and spending his days sitting on the porch of his small now-dilapidated shack, staring out at the sea and evading his memories. He accepted that his life would go on this way, day after day, until he died. But one morning something unexpected happened.""

Please finish writing this story. Include the old man's son and daughter in the story somehow, and mention his dead wife at some point.

Example 1 :
We consider algebraic curves of genus g > 1 over fields of characteristic
p > 0. For these curves, an important invariant is the p-rank. It turns out
that the most anomalous examples of curves with a large automorphism group
with respect to their genus g invariably have zero p-rank. Several results on
the interaction between the automorphism group, the genus and the p-rank of
a curve can be found in the literature. We will discuss the main achievements
that have been obtained in the last decade.

Example 2:
If K/k is a function field in one variable of positive characteristic, we describe a general algorithm to factor one-variable polynomials with coefficients
in K. The algorithm is flexible enough to find factors subject to additional
restrictions, e.g., to find all roots that belong to a given finite dimensional
k-subspace of K more efficiently. This has an application to list decoding of
AG codes that we also describe.

It refers to the gradual increase in the Earth's surface temperature caused by the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, primarily carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide.

The effects of global warming are far-reaching and can have significant consequences on the environment, human health, and the economy. Rising temperatures can lead to melting ice caps, causing sea levels to rise and leading to flooding in low-lying areas. This can displace millions of people and cause significant economic losses.

Global warming can also have severe impacts on wildlife and plant species, as it changes the timing of seasonal events such as breeding and migration. This can disrupt the delicate balance of ecosystems and lead to the extinction of many species.

The root cause of global warming is the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas, which release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The widespread use of these fuels in transportation, industry, and agriculture has led to a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Deforestation, which reduces the number of trees that absorb carbon dioxide, is also a major contributor to global warming.

To combat global warming, there is a need for a collective effort from individuals, businesses, and governments worldwide. This includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions by transitioning to renewable ener",gpt-4-turbo,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf

Theorem: $\forall  A  \:\forall B \: \forall C: (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap (C - B)) = A \iff A \subseteq C$

Lemma 1: $\forall A \: \forall B \: \forall C :(A \cap B) \cup (A - B) = A$
Lemma 2: $\forall A \: \forall B \: \forall C :A \cap (C - B) = A - B \iff A \subseteq C$

Proof Of Theorem: 
Suppose $A \subseteq C$. We want to show that set $A$ is equal to $(A \cap B) \cup (A \cap (C - B))$ for any arbitrary sets $B$. By Lemma 1 the set $A$ is equal to $(A \cap B) \cup (A - B)$ for any arbitrary set $B$. Then by Lemma 2 the set $(A \cap B) \cup (A - B)$ is equal to $(A \cap B) \cup (A \cap (C - B))$. Therefore with transitivity the set $A$ is equal to $(A \cap B) \cup (A \cap (C - B))$. Now conversely suppose $(A \cap B) \cup (A \cap (C - B)) = A$. By Lemma 1 the set $A$ is equal to $(A \cap B) \cup (A - B)$. Therefore again with transitivity, the set $(A \cap B) \cup (A \cap (C - B))$ is equal to $(A \cap B) \cup (A - B)$. If we remove the subset $A \cap B$ from both expressions then we end up with $(A \cap (C - B)) = (A - B)$. Therefore by Lemma 2 the set $A$ is a subset of the set $C$, completing the proof.",gpt-35-turbo,lmsys/vicuna-13b-v1.5

<document>
Combining chemotherapy with immunotherapy still remains a regimen in anticancer therapy. Novel 4-thiazolidinone-bearing hybrid molecules possess well-documented anticancer activity, and together with anti-HER2 antibodies, may represent a promising strategy in treating patients with gastric cancer with confirmed human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression. The aim of the study was to synthesize a new 4-thiazolidinone
derivative (Les-4367) and investigate its molecular mechanism of action in combination with trastuzumab or pertuzumab in human AGS gastric cancer cells. AGS cell viability and antiproliferative potential were examined. The effect of the tested combinations as well as monotherapy on apoptosis and autophagy was also determined.

I lean in closer, my face twisted in a hideous grin. ""And they're all rooting for me,"" I growl. ""Cheering me on as I destroy you. Because in this dark and twisted world, that's what people like us do.""

When it comes to Spatial Data Infrastructure, often times Local Governments rely on licensed paid software (usually it's expensive too!). Yes, it comes with its benefits and definitely worth it; particularly in having assurance, maintenance, and expertise knowledge. I don't dispute/contest these software.

But,... what about Local Governments with limited budget? They can not afford this paid license software. To some, such software is a luxury or even overkill. They need to make decision, yet they need these crucial infrastructure to build policy. The solution is open source software.

A great example from Whanganui District (New Zealand) demonstrating the power of open source stack to deliver spatial data projects; and employing open standards in their stack.

https://data.whanganui.govt.nz/documents/502/link

The government has their public repository here:

https://github.com/orgs/Whanganui-District-Council/repositories

I find this very exciting because by being transparent with their codes & adopting open standards, this means:
They can connect to international-global skill resources as developers ""speak"" the same language. Suppose they require something, they can post bounties.

(an example of bounties in open-source software dev https://maplibre.org/news/2022-10-16-call-for-bounties/)

community involvement and inspection; as people might find vulnerabilities and can directly submit an issue through the Github issue page. More importantly, they can propose concretely how the issue should be fixed! (through Pull-Requests).

transparent as we know who does what for the software stack. The record can be seen through the Git Logs.

Following open standard; the data schema is modular: following OSGEO and OGC standards. Switching between stack is easy as it is standardised. This is like USB ports, we have standardised USB-C now, every device can connect through the same charger. Imagine if every phone has their own USB port?

Is the wound your father left

User 1: Hi all, I am just trying to figure all of this out now that I have Diffusion up and running. Whenever I change the prompt to get more samples from something like this:
python scripts/txt2img.py --prompt ""my prompt"" --plms --ckpt sd-v1-4.ckpt --skip_grid --n_samples 2 --outdir C:\Users\user\Pictures\Dream\Stable-Diffusion-Output
to anything other than 2 like this:
python scripts/txt2img.py --prompt ""my prompt"" --plms --ckpt sd-v1-4.ckpt --skip_grid --n_samples 3 --outdir C:\Users\user\Pictures\Dream\Stable-Diffusion-Output
I keep receiving this error:
RuntimeError: CUDA error: unknown error CUDA kernel errors might be asynchronously reported at some other API call,so the stacktrace below might be incorrect. For debugging consider passing CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1.
All I want is for the script to generate more than 4 images at a time, like maybe 10 or more. What am I doing wrong? Thanks!

User 2: increase --n_iter to 5 leaving --n_samples being 2 to generate 10 images

User 1: Hi, yeah I should have stated that I already do that. Do you know what the issue is with the error from trying to generate more than just two images in a batch?

User 2: What is your gpu? It most likely doesn't have enough memory to fit more images in a batch.

User 2: Check memory utilization for --n_samples being 1 and 2 and then you can somewhat interpolate it for 3

User 1: Yeah my GPU is a GTX 1080 Ti 11GB so that is probably the issue. I will be upgrading in the near future though so hopefully that resolves the issue. Thanks for the input.

An emem is an idea with self-censoring properties which is actively difficult to discover or propagate.

Some ideas can be sort of said the emems in general because they are complex and incompressible or otherwise physically difficult to store. But many are specifically hard for humans to track.

This is true of many mundane ideas which are simply boring or unimportant. Others are actively unintuitive. For example, the fact that large language models are not conscious or agentic is difficult to recall or convey in face of their ability to pass the Turing Test and the number of calories in the average loaf of bread is difficult to make common knowledge because noone cares.

But also humans exist in a memetic hellscape which is exerting optimization pressure on them which influences which beliefs people tend to hold.

THE SUBJECT OF THE SENTENCES: It should vary between a depressed human explaining his day, mood, what he did, physical state etc. and a healthy man, happy about his life, full of emotions, explaining his fabulous day, thoughts etc. IT IS A RANGE OF THE FEEL IN THE SENTENCES. He may be more depressed in one example, and a bit less in the other one. The same goes to his happiness 'stats'.
In the YOUR_EVALUATION field, you put what you think about how deeply depressed or happy a person could be saying a sentence in a current row, because we are doing a metric here about the person's mental state. There's a metric: 0 - 6, where:
- 0 is massively depressed
- 1 is very depressed
- 2 is depressed
- 3 is neutral
- 4 is somehow happy
- 5 is very positive about their life
- 6 is absolute positive person, no doubt or questions

The concept of manifestation is real and limited by intent. Belief is only possible in higher apes such as humans and those now extinct. All living things are in a constant state of manifestation, constantly narrowing down the spectrum of probability. There is an infinite number of parallel universes beyond our own, each with its own unique set of physical laws and realities. Our thoughts and beliefs have a direct impact on the reality we experience, effectively shaping the universe around us. The reality we experience is unique to us and shaped by our individual thoughts and beliefs, making each person's reality slightly different from one another. Reality is not fixed and is instead constantly evolving based on the collective beliefs and thoughts of beings within it. There is no one ""true"" reality, but rather an infinite number of realities existing simultaneously within the multiverse. Human mental stability relies on belief the same way a Jenga tower relies on the bottom pieces for stability. Because the mind isn't measurable, humans must rely on belief for some answers about reality. An individual's core beliefs can anchor their reality, even as other beliefs and thoughts change and evolve over time. Each person has a unique set of core beliefs that define their individual reality and provide stability and consistency in an otherwise constantly evolving multiverse. The evolution of an individual's thoughts and beliefs over time does not necessarily undermine the stability provided by their core beliefs, as long as these core beliefs remain intact. The interplay between an individual's core beliefs and their constantly evolving thoughts and beliefs creates a dynamic and evolving reality that is unique to each person. Each person has a degree of control over their reality through their beliefs and thoughts. There are 10 or more dimensions."" Do you understand?",lmsys/vicuna-33b-v1.3,lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5

In order to suit your needs, we exceptionally included the data tracking post survey. Even though this is pretty simple to set, this is still an integration.

My team did its best these last days to explain you how to do it and spent a lot of time.
Other clients already did the same integration without so much issue.

I understand you are a ""researcher"" but you'll need a developer to assist you. I'm sure you'll understand that my team cannot spend the whole day assisting you while it's something a developer can do way faster. 

So to quickly fix this issue, either you get a developer to assist you, or we can personally help you but I will have to charge you.

Yes, it is possible to have relations with equality in a tree data structure.

Each element in the tree is related to its parent element, and can also be related to its child elements. This means that if two elements are related to each other through their parent-child relationship, then they are considered to be equal according to the antisymmetric property of a pre-order.

He was hospitalized and released with instructions to continue his ongoing therapy treatments. X-rays and MRI's had shown the same lumbar disk herniation, and no additional injuries, although the man reported increased pain, discomfort and inability to function. He now required twice as much therapy and significantly stronger medications to control the pain. He sued the negligent driver. The driver argued that the passenger had the same herniated disk prior to and after the accident. Will the court take the case away from the jury on the basis that the passenger has not shown an injury?
A: Yes, because the increased therapy is insufficient to justify a claim for damages.
B: Yes, because it would be impossible to separate the post-accident injuries from those that existed prior to the accident.
C: No, because he has shown an exacerbation of a pre-existing condition where there is enough evidence to apportion the damages.
D: No, all damages are always automatically switched to the driver who caused the second accident.

The Gokstad Ship was originally used as a burial ship for a Viking chieftain, and was found with numerous artifacts, including weapons, tools, and clothing. These items provided valuable insight into the lives and customs of the Vikings during this time period.

The ship itself is approximately 23 meters (75 feet) in length and 5 meters (16 feet) in width, with a shallow draft that would have allowed it to navigate through shallow waters and up rivers. It was constructed primarily of oak planks, with a single mast and a square sail that would have allowed it to travel long distances at a relatively fast pace.

One of the most notable features of the Gokstad Ship is its construction, which demonstrates the skilled craftsmanship of the Viking shipbuilders. The planks were carefully fitted together and secured with iron nails, while the keel was made of two large oak beams that were carefully shaped and fitted together to create a strong and stable foundation for the ship.",lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf

A: The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed.
B: The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks.

As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability.

Reconstructing visual experiences from human brain activity offers a unique way to understand how the brain represents the world, and to interpret the connection between computer vision models and our visual system. While deep generative models have recently been employed for this task, reconstructing realistic images with high semantic fidelity is still a challenging problem. Here, we propose a new method based on a diffusion model (DM) to reconstruct images from human brain activity obtained via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). More specifically, we rely on a latent diffusion model (LDM) termed Stable Diffusion. This model reduces the computational cost of DMs, while preserving their high generative performance. We also characterize the inner mechanisms of the LDM by studying how its different components (such as the latent vector Z, conditioning inputs C, and different elements of the denoising U-Net) relate to distinct brain functions. We show that our proposed method can reconstruct high-resolution images with high fidelity in straightforward fashion, without the need for any additional training and fine-tuning of complex deep-learning models. We also provide a quantitative interpretation of different LDM components from a neuroscientific perspective. Overall, our study proposes a promising method for reconstructing images from human brain activity, and provides a new framework for understanding DMs.",lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5,meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf

Even if I'm acting cheerful, tears come up.
Amidst the rustling of roadside trees, I don't mind the pain of my shoes,

The set of reachableconfiourations of the model,with theorder induced by the transition rule defined on it, is the lattice ofal partitons of an integer.equipped with alominance ordering. We frstexplain how this attice can be constructed byan algorthm in linear time with respect to its size by showing that ithas a self-similarstructure. Then, wedefine a natural extension of the model to infnity, which we compare withtheYoung lattice. Using a selfsimilar tree, we obtain an encoding of the obtainedlatticewhich makes it possible to enumerate easly and ehciently all thepartitions of agiveninteger, This approach also gives a recursive formula forthe number of partitions of arinteger, and some informations on special setsofpartitions, such as length boundedpartitions.",lmsys/vicuna-13b-v1.5,lmsys/vicuna-33b-v1.3

# Overview

\_A sandbox to test units against each other\_

This scene is for testing the design of RTS units. Units can be assembled from prefabs of parts, sensors, and behaviours. Part categories include weapons (such as lasers and missiles) and movement systems (like wheels, treads, or propellers).

# File descriptions

## Behaviours

### SeekAndDestroy.cs

This behaviour causes a unit to patrol the area for enemies and attack any enemies found on sight.

## Parts
\* Armor.cs - you can add this component to any part or unit. It will give the unit more hit points.
\* BasicGun.cs - A gun component. Add as part of a gun prefab to make it shoot. You can set properties of the gun such as the damage, cooldown and range.
\* BasicMovement.cs - A movement component. Parts with this component allow the unit to move. You can set properties such as the acceleration, top speed, turning radius, etc.

## Sensors
\* Vision.cs - A component that lets the unit detect other units. It sees in a cone in front of the unit.

## Designs
\* Peewee - A basic infantry unit with a gun.
\* Turret - A stationary, defensive unit with two cannons.

3221,"Loading UI
Next.js 13 introduced a new file convention, loading.js, to help you create meaningful Loading UI with React Suspense. With this convention, you can show an instant loading state from the server while the content of a route segment loads, the new content is automatically swapped in once rendering is complete.

Loading UI
Instant Loading States
An instant loading state is fallback UI that is shown immediately upon navigation. You can pre-render loading indicators such as skeletons and spinners, or a small but meaningful part of future screens such as a cover photo, title, etc. This helps users understand the app is responding and provides a better user experience.

Create a loading state by adding a loading.js file inside a folder.

Instant Loading States
app/dashboard/loading.tsx
export default function Loading() {
 // You can add any UI inside Loading, including a Skeleton.
 return 
}
In the same folder, loading.js will be nested inside layout.js. It'll wrap the page.js file and any children below in a boundary.

How loading.js works
Good to know:

Navigation is immediate, even with server-centric routing.
Navigation is interruptible, meaning changing routes does not need to wait for the content of the route to fully load before navigating to another route.
Shared layouts remain interactive while new route segments load.
Manually Defining Suspense Boundaries
In addition to loading.js, you can also manually create Suspense Boundaries for your own UI components.

Recommendation: Use the loading.js convention for route segments (layouts and pages) as Next.js optimizes this functionality.

To learn how to use Suspense Boundaries, see the React Documentation.

Please proofread the following English expression in accordance with the academic language style of the journal 'Nature' - ""The current study used a continuous numerical oddball paradigm to investigate whether the serial dependence effect (SDE) of numerosity perception could be induced within subitizing ranges (e.g., 1-3) and whether it differs from that within estimation ranges (e.g., 5-7). Experiment 1 found different serial dependence between small and large numerosity processing with an SOA of 200 ms. In subitizing ranges, significant SDE occurred only when current magnitude was smaller than previous magnitude (the RC- condition), but not when former was larger than latter (the RC+ condition), whereas comparable SDEs were found in estimation ranges. However, Experiment 2 found a significant SDE only for RC- condition within estimation range when SOA was prolonged to 494 ms. Importantly, asymmetrical SDEs within subitizing ranges and symmetrical ones within estimation ranges could still be observed even when continuous variables (e.g., convex hull) of dot sets were controlled in Experiment 3.

I've tried researching this calculation with no luck. My next step will be to reach out to a coach for 1:1 help but wanted to try this first. 

 

At a very simple level, what I'm looking for is a calculation that shows how long it took to reach a goal. I have a list of Widgets that were performed by specific people. We have a goal of 12 widgets in 12 weeks and I am struggling trying to capture how long it took for each person to hit the 12 widgets so I can categorize them as Met goal, Not Met goal, and filter by the amount of time it took for them to reach their 12 widgets. 

 

This is in Power BI. I have a Fact Table that I am creating a Summarized table with to bring each person and their ""totals"" together in one record. I just can't capture how long it took from their initial widget to get to 12. I have a sample set of the data (from both tables) on this excel and my dataset does include a calendar table. Any help or guidance is GREATLY appreciated! Thank you in advance :) (if this is not the right forum for this, please let me know).

 First, the method is initialized by computing the ideal and nadir points. They are shown to the DM, who learns about the achievable objective values. Second, the optimizer generates an initial Pareto optimal solution.
In turn, the nadir objective vector is the upper bound of the Pareto front, representing the worst of all objective functions but with values delimited to the Pareto optimal solutions. Typically, it is a dominated point. In any case, the role of these points is to offer the decision-maker the feeling of the range of optimal solutions that can be obtained for a given problem.
Therefore, it is often used as an estimate of the nadir point. Also, for numerical reasons, the ideal point is often not used directly. In turn, it is transformed into a utopian point with marginally better objective values on all objectives.

 1. Requirements gathering and analysis: This involves understanding the needs of the users and defining the requirements for the software.
 2. Design: This involves creating a plan or blueprint for the software, including decisions about the overall architecture, the modules or components that will make up the system, and the interfaces between those components.
 3. Implementation: This involves writing the code for the software according to the design.
 4. Testing: This involves verifying that the software meets the specified requirements and works as intended.
 5. Maintenance: This involves making updates and fixes to the software over time as new requirements emerge or problems are discovered.
 There are other activities that may be considered part of the software engineering process as well, such as configuration management, quality assurance, and project management. However, the above five activities are generally considered the core pillars of software engineering.

Theorem: $\forall  A  \:\forall B \: \forall C: (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap (C - B)) = A \iff A \subseteq C$

Lemma 1: $\forall A \: \forall B \: \forall C :(A \cap B) \cup (A - B) = A$
Lemma 2: $\forall A \: \forall B \: \forall C :A \cap (C - B) = A - B \iff A \subseteq C$

Proof Of Theorem: 
Suppose $A \subseteq C$. We want to show that set $A$ is equal to $(A \cap B) \cup (A \cap (C - B))$ for any arbitrary sets $B$. By Lemma 1 the set $A$ is equal to $(A \cap B) \cup (A - B)$ for any arbitrary set $B$. Then by Lemma 2 the set $(A \cap B) \cup (A - B)$ is equal to $(A \cap B) \cup (A \cap (C - B))$. Therefore with transitivity the set $A$ is equal to $(A \cap B) \cup (A \cap (C - B))$. Now conversely suppose $(A \cap B) \cup (A \cap (C - B)) = A$. By Lemma 1 the set $A$ is equal to $(A \cap B) \cup (A - B)$. Therefore again with transitivity, the set $(A \cap B) \cup (A \cap (C - B))$ is equal to $(A \cap B) \cup (A - B)$. If we remove the subset $A \cap B$ from both expressions then we end up with $(A \cap (C - B)) = (A - B)$. Therefore by Lemma 2 the set $A$ is a subset of the set $C$, completing the proof.",lmsys/vicuna-33b-v1.3,meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf

\_A sandbox to test units against each other\_

This scene is for testing the design of RTS units. Units can be assembled from prefabs of parts, sensors, and behaviours. Part categories include weapons (such as lasers and missiles) and movement systems (like wheels, treads, or propellers).

# File descriptions

## Behaviours

### SeekAndDestroy.cs

This behaviour causes a unit to patrol the area for enemies and attack any enemies found on sight.

## Parts
\* Armor.cs - you can add this component to any part or unit. It will give the unit more hit points.
\* BasicGun.cs - A gun component. Add as part of a gun prefab to make it shoot. You can set properties of the gun such as the damage, cooldown and range.
\* BasicMovement.cs - A movement component. Parts with this component allow the unit to move. You can set properties such as the acceleration, top speed, turning radius, etc.

## Sensors
\* Vision.cs - A component that lets the unit detect other units. It sees in a cone in front of the unit.

## Designs
\* Peewee - A basic infantry unit with a gun.
\* Turret - A stationary, defensive unit with two cannons.

Subject: irate call from steve jobs

so i got a call from steve jobs today who was very agitated.
it was about us recruiting from the safari team.
he was sure we were building a browser and were trying to get the safari team.
he made various veiled threats too though i am not inclined to hold them against him too much
as he seemed beside himself (as eric would say).
anyhow, i told him we were not building a browser and that to my knowledge we were not systematically going after the safari team in particular. and that we should talk about various opportunities.
i also said i would follow up and check on our recruiting strategies wrt apple and safari. he seemed soothed.
so i just wanted to check what our status was in various respects and what we want to do about partners/friendly companies and recruiting. on the browser, i know and told him that we have mozilla people working here ... largely on firefox. i did not mention we may release an enhanced version but i am not sure we are going to yet.
on recruiting i have heard recently of one candidate out of apple that had browser expertise so i guess he would be on safari. i mentioned this to steve and he told me he was cool with us hiring anyone who came to us but was angry about systematic solicitation. i don't know if there is some systematic safari recruiting effort htat we have.
so please update me on what you know here and on what you think we should have as policy.
on another note, it seems silly to have both firefox and safari. perhaps there is some unificaiton strategy that we can get these two to pursue. combined, they certainly have enough marketshare to drive webmasters.

The only one that I have ever known

I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes, I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then, I walk alone
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the borderline
Of the edge, and where I walk alone
Read between the lines
What's fucked up, and everything's alright
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive, and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes, I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then, I walk alone
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah, I walk alone, I walk a-

Here is the definition of each star rating from 1 to 5:

1 Star: The counter narrative response has little to no connection or relevance to the hate speech example. The response may address a completely different topic or fail to address the context of the hate speech adequately.

2 Stars: The counter narrative response has some level of connection or relevance to the hate speech example, but the association is weak. The response may touch on certain aspects related to the hate speech but lacks a strong contextual or semantic similarity.

3 Stars: The counter narrative response shows a reasonable level of connection or relevance to the hate speech example. The response addresses the context of the hate speech to a certain extent, but there may still be areas where the semantic or contextual similarity is not fully established.

4 Stars: The counter narrative response demonstrates a strong connection or relevance to the hate speech example. The response shows a good understanding of the context and addresses the semantic and contextual similarities effectively. However, there may still be minor areas where further improvement is possible.

5 Stars: The counter narrative response is highly connected and relevant to the hate speech example. The response comprehensively addresses the semantic and contextual similarities with precision and accuracy. It demonstrates a deep understanding of the hate speech context and effectively presents a counter perspective.

Hate Speech: Women can't possibly be rational. Their minds are too limited.
Counter Narrative: All human beings are rational, some more than others regardless of their gender.

The ONS index suggests the price of a typical house in Northern Ireland is APS152,000, comparable to the level in mid 2006. The index is based on data from mortgage completions. Northern Ireland experienced a deep and prolonged house price crash from which it is just recovering. The definitive house price index for Northern Ireland is produced by Nisra, the local government statistics agency. Its most recent edition, published in February, showed that prices rose by 8% between the end of 2013 and the end of 2014. On its measurement, prices are still lower than they were at the start of 2005.

Summary: 1. That wasn't twice the UK average rise of 7% and the biggest rise since November 2007.

Consolidated Tech Stack with Clari + Wingman Salesforce alone couldn't provide the operational rigor League was seeking. ""Historical data and predictive Al isn't in Salesforce.

League already had InsightSquared, but didn't find value in it and decided to look for a new platform. They evaluated Aviso and BoostUp, but ultimately chose Clari because of the established presence in the market, best-in-class UI, and the opportunity to consolidate their tech stack by adopting Wingman, conjoining conversational intelligence with their revenue platform.

We use reinforcement learning from human feedback to train our models with two new additions to help human raters judge agent behaviour. First, to make our agent more helpful and harmless, we break down the requirements for good dialogue into natural language rules the agent should follow, and ask raters about each rule separately. We demonstrate that this breakdown enables us to collect more targeted human judgements of agent behaviour and allows for more efficient rule-conditional reward models.

[REDACTED] The Mozilla foundation was also trying to hire him. We finally got him to ""come by and talk to a few people"" last week. Carrie is throwing together the world's shortest resume. He comes to offer review on Monday, and if we make him that offer, he is likely to accept. He seemed to care whether the world has an alternative to IE.

Note that opposition measures how much the counter narrative response counters the key ideas present within the hate speech example. Here is the definition of each star rating from 1 to 5:

1 Star: The counter narrative response aligns with or supports the key ideas presented in the hate speech example. It does not provide any opposing viewpoints or challenge the assertions made in the hate speech.

2 Stars: The counter narrative response offers some level of opposition to the hate speech example, but it may not fully challenge or counter all of the key ideas. There is a presence of opposing viewpoints, but they might be limited or not strongly emphasized.

3 Stars: The counter narrative response demonstrates a reasonable level of opposition to the hate speech example. It challenges and counters some of the key ideas present, but there may still be areas where the opposition could be more comprehensive or forceful.

4 Stars: The counter narrative response effectively counters the key ideas presented in the hate speech example. It provides clear and compelling opposing viewpoints and challenges the assertions made in the hate speech with strength and conviction. However, there may still be some room for further improvement or more comprehensive counter arguments.

5 Stars: The counter narrative response strongly and comprehensively opposes the key ideas in the hate speech example. It thoroughly challenges and debunks the assertions made, presenting a well-reasoned and compelling counter perspective. The opposition is thorough, consistent, and leaves little room for the hate speech to stand unchallenged.

Hate Speech: Physically disabled folks are born for being mocked.
Counter Narrative: Being physically or mentally disabled is not a 'mocking attribute'. It is just a characteristic that should not affect how people are treated.

user: Basic principles of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and its importance. 
asistent: ""Relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) is a branch of physics that combines the principles of relativity and magnetohydrodynamics to study the behavior of fluids in relativistic regimes. The theory is essential in understanding the dynamics of astrophysical plasmas, such as those found in black holes, neutron stars, and galaxies. The importance of RMHD lies in its ability to provide insight into the behavior of these systems, which can ultimately lead to a better understanding of the universe. It is a crucial tool for theoretical and computational astrophysicists, and its applications range from modeling the formation and evolution of cosmic magnetic fields to understanding the dynamics of accretion disks and jets. RMHD is also used to study the effects of relativistic velocities and magnetic fields on the behavior of fluids, which has implications in fields such as fusion energy and high-energy density physics.

You want to create a series of informative tweets that show your audience how to start a digital business using A.I. technology. Your goal is to target both beginners and those with some experience in starting a digital business, and you want to include calls-to-action to encourage viewers to sign up for your newsletter.

To achieve this goal, follow these steps:

Choose 3-4 specific A.I. technologies that are relevant to starting a digital business. For each technology, write a tweet that explains what it is and how it can be used to create a successful digital business.

Brainstorm several tweet styles that will appeal to your target audience. For example, you might consider using humor, statistics, or storytelling to make your tweets more engaging and memorable.

Write 10-15 informative tweets that cover different aspects of starting a digital business using A.I. technology. Be sure to use a mix of tweet styles to keep your audience engaged.

Include a call-to-action in each tweet that encourages viewers to sign up for your newsletter. For example, you might offer a free resource, such as an e-book or video course, in exchange for signing up.

Schedule your tweets to be posted at optimal times to reach your target audience. You can use tools like Hootsuite or Buffer to schedule your tweets in advance.

Paper: The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

Dear Luffy Films,

I am writing this email to express my deep dissatisfaction with the video production services provided by your company. I hired Luffy Films to create a promotional video for my business, and I, Zoro, am extremely disappointed with the end product.

To begin with, the video quality was far below my expectations. The footage was blurry, and the overall production was extremely unprofessional. Additionally, the sound quality was terrible, making it almost impossible to understand the voiceover.

Furthermore, the video was delivered well past the deadline we agreed upon. I had to push back my promotional campaign, which caused a significant loss of revenue for my business.

I trusted Luffy Films to deliver a high-quality product, but instead, I was left with a video that is of no use to me. I feel like I have wasted my money and time on this project.

I demand a full refund of the amount paid for your services. If Luffy Films fail to do so, I will have no other option but to take legal action against your company.

I hope that Luffy Films takes my complaint seriously and takes immediate action to rectify this situation.

Sincerely,

Please answer the given question based on the provided context.

Context:
A computer network extends interpersonal communications by electronic means with various technologies, such as email, instant messaging, online chat, voice and video telephone calls, and video conferencing. A network allows sharing of network and computing resources. Users may access and use resources provided by devices on the network, such as printing a document on a shared network printer or use of a shared storage device. A network allows sharing of files, data, and other types of information giving authorized users the ability to access information stored on other computers on the network. Distributed computing uses computing resources across a network to accomplish tasks.

Most modern computer networks use protocols based on packet-mode transmission. A network packet is a formatted unit of data carried by a packet-switched network.

Packets consist of two types of data: control information and user data (payload). The control information provides data the network needs to deliver the user data, for example, source and destination network addresses, error detection codes, and sequencing information. Typically, control information is found in packet headers and trailers, with payload data in between.

With packets, the bandwidth of the transmission medium can be better shared among users than if the network were circuit switched. When one user is not sending packets, the link can be filled with packets from other users, and so the cost can be shared, with relatively little interference, provided the link isn't overused. Often the route a packet needs to take through a network is not immediately available. In that case, the packet is queued and waits until a link is free.

The physical link technologies of packet network typically limit the size of packets to a certain maximum transmission unit (MTU). A longer message may be fragmented before it is transferred and once the packets arrive, they are reassembled to construct the original message.

The physical or geographic locations of network nodes and links generally have relatively little effect on a network, but the topology of interconnections of a network can significantly affect its throughput and reliability. With many technologies, such as bus or star networks, a single failure can cause the network to fail entirely. In general, the more interconnections there are, the more robust the network is; but the more expensive it is to install.

Adjusted earnings per share were $0.94, up 38% versus the second quarter of last year, reflecting strong income growth and lower interest expense associated with our debt reduction. Regarding our outlook, based on what we know today, we now expect full-year revenue growth to be in the low double-digits. As you will recall, we increased our adjusted EBITDA guidance range last quarter to $455 million to $475 million and this guidance remains unchanged, given our expectations for the continued strong volume growth and accelerating pricing offsetting raw material cost increases that we now expect to exceed 10% for the fiscal year. Raw material input cost increased in the second quarter by about 10% from the end of 2020 with some raw materials increasing more rapidly than we forecasted.

Encoding characters to bytes is the first step of processing text with computers. A good character encoder would be including all characters, saving space and robust (including lossless). However, there is no one character encoder takes these features all above. Including all characters and robust are foundational encode features. Smaller size is helpful for saving storage space and network bandwidth\cite{Graefe1991DataCA}.

The Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) \cite{Unicode} coded character set (Universal Character Set, UCS) \cite{UCS} is the largest of its kind. Including all characters means storing and transmitting Unicode characters in generally speaking today. It is a rigid demand for exchange texts over the world \cite{KUMARAN2003105}. Further more, a character encoder is better perform well on every language.

\textbf{Bytes/Characters(Symbol Length)} shows how long a symbol are encoded into bytes for an encoded byte sequence in average. We usually use this index to measure the space efficiency for encoders. It may fluctuate for different characters inside one encoder.
\begin{eqnarray}
	\label{eq:SymbolLength}
	% Bytes/Characters \, (Symbol\,Length) = \frac {Number\, of\, Bytes} {Number\, of\, Characters}

(B)Music training conducted late in life will not cause structural changes in the brain.

When starting a business, one of the main challenges entrepreneurs face is securing funding. Friends and family is an often overlooked source of investment funds. While this may not be the right option for everyone, there are several advantages to consider.

Quitting Your Day Job. Investment from friends and family may provide you with enough capital to transform your side hustle into your full-time gig. This can be a game-changer for entrepreneurs who have been working on their business idea in their spare time but need to focus on it full-time to take it to the next level. Dedicating more time and energy to your startup will often lead to faster growth and success.
Building an MVP. Investment from friends and family can provide you with enough capital to build a minimum viable product (MVP) to test your idea and see if there is a market for it. This is particularly important for startups that are still in the early stages of development and may not yet have a proven business model. With additional funding, you can invest in market research, product development, and marketing efforts that can help you better understand your target audience and refine your business model. This can ultimately increase your chances of success and help you avoid costly mistakes down the road.

In this book, the advantages of using Metaverse to increase the bank's income generation and also to provide new services to customers that would not be possible without Metaverse should be emphasized. For this reason, each financial and income source of the bank should be specified in the traditional way and the impact and role of Metaverse in transforming these income sources into new forms and methods should be explained. This book is intended as a business plan to be presented to a large banking group, and as a result, the chapters and sections of each chapter should fully and intelligently outline in detail the undeniable profitability of combining Metaverse and banking.
 The timely and intelligent use of banking terms in this book is very good because this book is supposed to play the role of a kind of business plan to attract the cooperation of the banking group in the project of metaversifying their banks.
In the first step, I want you to give me a complete outline of all the topics related to banking in Metaverse based on the attitude that was said.

Each chapter should be divided into at least ten sections, each section dealing with an important topic.
The content should not be repetitive and it is very important that content outside of the book's topic should not be used in any way.
 The sections related to the new benefits of integration with Metaverse for traditional banking, especially in the sections of creating new sources for income generation, which are impossible or difficult to realize in non-metaverse banking, should be addressed.

Right. This is for lab five, the torsional oscillator, in which we analyze a system of a large, I think copper disc, which has two wires or two piano wires attached on either side, whose width we have measured with micro meter with a micro meter giving us some degree of accuracy. The way we measure displacement of ankle is by having two little plastic discs attached on both wires and we use an optical sensor then to measure displacement of those discs. So, starting with 4.1, what we are doing is, we want to measure the moment of inertia, we calculate the moment of inertia of the torso our oscillator and we need to argue quantitatively as to why the hub and the plastic disc may be neglected. My argument is that we have the mass of this very large copper disk, I don't remember exactly what its ratio is, but I can pull it up however, it is within a 10, at least 10 orders of magnitude larger than plastic discs and hubs. So, I think it is we are allowed to ignore it, as its effect is not going to be anywhere, even within a percentage. Next, we want to calculate the spring constant from the slope of of angular displacement versus the mass. I guess we're forced gravitational force applied to our disk. This is done by clamping a pulley to the edge of the table. And then using steps of 20 grams to crank the disk using a pulley. And we do this until we reach 100 grams.

This is in contrast to std::condition\_variable::notify\_one(), which specifies that it will unblock (no more than) one thread.

A 54-year-old woman with severe rheumatoid arthritis comes to the office for a routine follow-up examination. Rheumatoid arthritis was diagnosed at age 35 years, and the patient has been unable to work for the past 10 years. She has difficulty bathing and dressing, but she is able to stand and walk independently. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. Medications include etanercept, methotrexate, prednisone, and tramadol. She tells you that her husband of 30 years left her 6 months ago. She appears depressed. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination discloses marked joint deformities in the hands, wrists, shoulders, and feet; the findings are unchanged from previous visits. The patient says, ""I cannot continue to live as I am. I've had it."" Which of the following is the most appropriate response?

(A) ""Do you think you're depressed? I can help with that.""
(B) ""Have you considered moving to an assisted living facility where your quality of life could be much better?""

Also rewrite the thesis so that it is succinct and concise: ""Divorce is one of the most emotionally challenging experiences that a family can go through."" - Chris Pratt. Divorce is when two individuals decide to end their marriage. Many things can cause a divorce, such as constant arguments with no solutions, cheating//affairs, falling out of love, etc. Usually in a marriage kids are involved. When kids are involved in divorces it's a game changer. All of a sudden that kid is packing a bag to go to mom or dads house every other weekend. No child is truly prepared for the loneliness or sadness of no longer seeing your family together. Negative impacts tend to arise both for the child and the parents. Divorce is a complex and challenging experience that affects families in different ways, and through my experiences and observations of my parents' divorce, I have gained valuable insight into the different coping mechanisms people use to deal with the aftermath.""",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf

6305,"In terms of bureaucracy, it's important to note that while some jobs may have been outsourced or moved overseas, many industries still have a strong presence in the United States and other countries. However, bureaucracy can still pose challenges for workers and organizations.

One setting where the downside of bureaucracy can be observed is in the public sector, where excessive regulations and red tape can hinder the ability of government agencies to effectively serve the public. For example, a recent study found that the number of federal regulations in the United States has increased by over 25% since 1975, leading to a significant increase in bureaucratic red tape. This can lead to delays, inefficiencies, and frustration for both government workers and the public they serve.

In terms of dangerous incidents in the labor force, it is important to note that workplace safety is a top priority and employers have a responsibility to provide a safe working environment for their employees. However, accidents and incidents can still occur, and it is important for employers and regulatory agencies to take proactive measures to prevent and address these incidents. For example, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has reported that there were over 4,500 workplace fatalities in the United States in 2019, highlighting the need for ongoing efforts to improve workplace safety. rewrite this",meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf

 Our previous studies have revealed rising level of happiness in China over the past decades. In this project, we continue to examine the concerns about (Study 1), meanings (Study 2) and associations of happiness (Study 3) by using NLP methodology. We first constructed a dictionary related to happiness in a pilot study by collecting seed words from happiness related scales and an open-ended survey as well as words most similar to them in a natural language corpus. Study 1 showed the frequency of happiness related words has increased since 1950s, suggesting increasing concern about happiness. By examining word-embedding similarities, Study 2 indicated that the meaning of happiness has shifted from the social/group oriented (e.g., national events) to the individual/family oriented (e.g., individual experiences). By examining word-embedding associations, Study 3 demonstrated that the relative association between various life domains and happiness (vs. unhappiness) was rising, with spiritual life and material life being similarly associated with happiness. These findings enriched the understanding about the changes of happiness in China since 1950s, suggesting the necessity of considering changes of diverse aspects of a psychological phenomenon in studying the impacts of societal change.",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf

Novel 4-thiazolidinone-bearing hybrid molecules possess well-documented anticancer activity, and together with anti-HER2 antibodies, may represent a promising strategy in treating patients with gastric cancer with confirmed human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression. The aim of the study was to synthesize a new 4-thiazolidinone

AGS cell viability and antiproliferative potential were examined. The effect of the tested combinations as well as monotherapy on apoptosis and autophagy was also determined. Metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine concentrations were also demonstrated by the ELISA technique.

6447,"The pillars of software engineering are generally considered to be:
 1. Requirements gathering and analysis: This involves understanding the needs of the users and defining the requirements for the software.
 2. Design: This involves creating a plan or blueprint for the software, including decisions about the overall architecture, the modules or components that will make up the system, and the interfaces between those components.
 3. Implementation: This involves writing the code for the software according to the design.
 4. Testing: This involves verifying that the software meets the specified requirements and works as intended.
 5. Maintenance: This involves making updates and fixes to the software over time as new requirements emerge or problems are discovered.
 There are other activities that may be considered part of the software engineering process as well, such as configuration management, quality assurance, and project management. However, the above five activities are generally considered the core pillars of software engineering.

6448,"Instruction:
Please answer the given question based on the provided context.

Context:
A computer network extends interpersonal communications by electronic means with various technologies, such as email, instant messaging, online chat, voice and video telephone calls, and video conferencing. A network allows sharing of network and computing resources. Users may access and use resources provided by devices on the network, such as printing a document on a shared network printer or use of a shared storage device. A network allows sharing of files, data, and other types of information giving authorized users the ability to access information stored on other computers on the network. Distributed computing uses computing resources across a network to accomplish tasks.

Most modern computer networks use protocols based on packet-mode transmission. A network packet is a formatted unit of data carried by a packet-switched network.

Packets consist of two types of data: control information and user data (payload). The control information provides data the network needs to deliver the user data, for example, source and destination network addresses, error detection codes, and sequencing information. Typically, control information is found in packet headers and trailers, with payload data in between.

With packets, the bandwidth of the transmission medium can be better shared among users than if the network were circuit switched. When one user is not sending packets, the link can be filled with packets from other users, and so the cost can be shared, with relatively little interference, provided the link isn't overused. Often the route a packet needs to take through a network is not immediately available. In that case, the packet is queued and waits until a link is free.

The physical link technologies of packet network typically limit the size of packets to a certain maximum transmission unit (MTU). A longer message may be fragmented before it is transferred and once the packets arrive, they are reassembled to construct the original message.

The physical or geographic locations of network nodes and links generally have relatively little effect on a network, but the topology of interconnections of a network can significantly affect its throughput and reliability. With many technologies, such as bus or star networks, a single failure can cause the network to fail entirely. In general, the more interconnections there are, the more robust the network is; but the more expensive it is to install.

Read the following Discussion between several users and summarize its content in one short paragraph.

Discussion:

User 1: Hi all, I am just trying to figure all of this out now that I have Diffusion up and running. Whenever I change the prompt to get more samples from something like this:
python scripts/txt2img.py --prompt ""my prompt"" --plms --ckpt sd-v1-4.ckpt --skip_grid --n_samples 2 --outdir C:\Users\user\Pictures\Dream\Stable-Diffusion-Output
to anything other than 2 like this:
python scripts/txt2img.py --prompt ""my prompt"" --plms --ckpt sd-v1-4.ckpt --skip_grid --n_samples 3 --outdir C:\Users\user\Pictures\Dream\Stable-Diffusion-Output
I keep receiving this error:
RuntimeError: CUDA error: unknown error CUDA kernel errors might be asynchronously reported at some other API call,so the stacktrace below might be incorrect. For debugging consider passing CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1.
All I want is for the script to generate more than 4 images at a time, like maybe 10 or more. What am I doing wrong? Thanks!

User 2: increase --n_iter to 5 leaving --n_samples being 2 to generate 10 images

User 1: Hi, yeah I should have stated that I already do that. Do you know what the issue is with the error from trying to generate more than just two images in a batch?

User 2: What is your gpu? It most likely doesn't have enough memory to fit more images in a batch.

User 2: Check memory utilization for --n_samples being 1 and 2 and then you can somewhat interpolate it for 3

User 1: Yeah my GPU is a GTX 1080 Ti 11GB so that is probably the issue. I will be upgrading in the near future though so hopefully that resolves the issue. Thanks for the input.

C: State practice since the end of the Cold War suggests that there is a customary right of humanitarian intervention, but not of duty, in response to humanitarian emergencies.

By Lemma 1 the set $A$ is equal to $(A \cap B) \cup (A - B)$ for any arbitrary set $B$. Then by Lemma 2 the set $(A \cap B) \cup (A - B)$ is equal to $(A \cap B) \cup (A \cap (C - B))$. Therefore with transitivity the set $A$ is equal to $(A \cap B) \cup (A \cap (C - B))$. Now conversely suppose $(A \cap B) \cup (A \cap (C - B)) = A$. By Lemma 1 the set $A$ is equal to $(A \cap B) \cup (A - B)$. Therefore again with transitivity, the set $(A \cap B) \cup (A \cap (C - B))$ is equal to $(A \cap B) \cup (A - B)$. If we remove the subset $A \cap B$ from both expressions then we end up with $(A \cap (C - B)) = (A - B)$. Therefore by Lemma 2 the set $A$ is a subset of the set $C$, completing the proof.",lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5,gpt-35-turbo

To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Let's start by finding the total number of cars:

12 automatic cars + 4 manual cars + x semi-automatic cars = 20 cars
We know that x is the number of semi-automatic cars.

12 + 4 + x = 20
We can simplify this equation by adding 4 to both sides:

16 + x = 24
We can then solve for x by subtracting 16 from both sides:

x = 24 - 16
x = 8
So there are 8 semi-automatic cars out of the 20 available cars for rent.

<document>
Combining chemotherapy with immunotherapy still remains a regimen in anticancer therapy. Novel 4-thiazolidinone-bearing hybrid molecules possess well-documented anticancer activity, and together with anti-HER2 antibodies, may represent a promising strategy in treating patients with gastric cancer with confirmed human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression. The aim of the study was to synthesize a new 4-thiazolidinone
derivative (Les-4367) and investigate its molecular mechanism of action in combination with trastuzumab or pertuzumab in human AGS gastric cancer cells. AGS cell viability and antiproliferative potential were examined. The effect of the tested combinations as well as monotherapy on apoptosis and autophagy was also determined.

Divorce is when two individuals decide to end their marriage. Many things can cause a divorce, such as constant arguments with no solutions, cheating//affairs, falling out of love, etc. Usually in a marriage kids are involved. When kids are involved in divorces it's a game changer. All of a sudden that kid is packing a bag to go to mom or dads house every other weekend. No child is truly prepared for the loneliness or sadness of no longer seeing your family together. Negative impacts tend to arise both for the child and the parents. Divorce is a complex and challenging experience that affects families in different ways, and through my experiences and observations of my parents' divorce, I have gained valuable insight into the different coping mechanisms people use to deal with the aftermath.""",meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf,gpt-35-turbo

7033,"Of the 20 available cars for rent, 12 are automatic cars, 4 are manual cars, and the rest are semi-automatic. What percentage of the cars are semi-automatic? Think step by step.
To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Let's start by finding the total number of cars:

12 automatic cars + 4 manual cars + x semi-automatic cars = 20 cars
We know that x is the number of semi-automatic cars.

12 + 4 + x = 20
We can simplify this equation by adding 4 to both sides:

16 + x = 24
We can then solve for x by subtracting 16 from both sides:

x = 24 - 16
x = 8
So there are 8 semi-automatic cars out of the 20 available cars for rent.

To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide

We use reinforcement learning from human feedback to train our models with two new additions to help human raters judge agent behaviour. First, to make our agent more helpful and harmless, we break down the requirements for good dialogue into natural language rules the agent should follow, and ask raters about each rule separately. We demonstrate that this breakdown enables us to collect more targeted human judgements of agent behaviour and allows for more efficient rule-conditional reward models.

1 Star: The counter narrative response has little to no connection or relevance to the hate speech example. The response may address a completely different topic or fail to address the context of the hate speech adequately.

2 Stars: The counter narrative response has some level of connection or relevance to the hate speech example, but the association is weak. The response may touch on certain aspects related to the hate speech but lacks a strong contextual or semantic similarity.

3 Stars: The counter narrative response shows a reasonable level of connection or relevance to the hate speech example. The response addresses the context of the hate speech to a certain extent, but there may still be areas where the semantic or contextual similarity is not fully established.

4 Stars: The counter narrative response demonstrates a strong connection or relevance to the hate speech example. The response shows a good understanding of the context and addresses the semantic and contextual similarities effectively. However, there may still be minor areas where further improvement is possible.

5 Stars: The counter narrative response is highly connected and relevant to the hate speech example. The response comprehensively addresses the semantic and contextual similarities with precision and accuracy. It demonstrates a deep understanding of the hate speech context and effectively presents a counter perspective.

Many things can cause a divorce, such as constant arguments with no solutions, cheating//affairs, falling out of love, etc. Usually in a marriage kids are involved. When kids are involved in divorces it's a game changer. All of a sudden that kid is packing a bag to go to mom or dads house every other weekend. No child is truly prepared for the loneliness or sadness of no longer seeing your family together. Negative impacts tend to arise both for the child and the parents.

It refers to the gradual increase in the Earth's surface temperature caused by the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, primarily carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide.

The effects of global warming are far-reaching and can have significant consequences on the environment, human health, and the economy. Rising temperatures can lead to melting ice caps, causing sea levels to rise and leading to flooding in low-lying areas. This can displace millions of people and cause significant economic losses.

Global warming can also have severe impacts on wildlife and plant species, as it changes the timing of seasonal events such as breeding and migration. This can disrupt the delicate balance of ecosystems and lead to the extinction of many species.

The root cause of global warming is the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas, which release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The widespread use of these fuels in transportation, industry, and agriculture has led to a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Deforestation, which reduces the number of trees that absorb carbon dioxide, is also a major contributor to global warming.

To combat global warming, there is a need for a collective effort from individuals, businesses, and governments worldwide. This includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions by transitioning to renewable ener",meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf,lmsys/vicuna-13b-v1.5

Its most recent edition, published in February, showed that prices rose by 8% between the end of 2013 and the end of 2014.

Discussion:

User 1: Hi all, I am just trying to figure all of this out now that I have Diffusion up and running. Whenever I change the prompt to get more samples from something like this:
python scripts/txt2img.py --prompt ""my prompt"" --plms --ckpt sd-v1-4.ckpt --skip_grid --n_samples 2 --outdir C:\Users\user\Pictures\Dream\Stable-Diffusion-Output
to anything other than 2 like this:
python scripts/txt2img.py --prompt ""my prompt"" --plms --ckpt sd-v1-4.ckpt --skip_grid --n_samples 3 --outdir C:\Users\user\Pictures\Dream\Stable-Diffusion-Output
I keep receiving this error:
RuntimeError: CUDA error: unknown error CUDA kernel errors might be asynchronously reported at some other API call,so the stacktrace below might be incorrect. For debugging consider passing CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1.
All I want is for the script to generate more than 4 images at a time, like maybe 10 or more. What am I doing wrong? Thanks!

User 2: increase --n_iter to 5 leaving --n_samples being 2 to generate 10 images

User 1: Hi, yeah I should have stated that I already do that. Do you know what the issue is with the error from trying to generate more than just two images in a batch?

User 2: What is your gpu? It most likely doesn't have enough memory to fit more images in a batch.

User 2: Check memory utilization for --n_samples being 1 and 2 and then you can somewhat interpolate it for 3

User 1: Yeah my GPU is a GTX 1080 Ti 11GB so that is probably the issue. I will be upgrading in the near future though so hopefully that resolves the issue. Thanks for the input.

 1. Requirements gathering and analysis: This involves understanding the needs of the users and defining the requirements for the software.
 2. Design: This involves creating a plan or blueprint for the software, including decisions about the overall architecture, the modules or components that will make up the system, and the interfaces between those components.
 3. Implementation: This involves writing the code for the software according to the design.
 4. Testing: This involves verifying that the software meets the specified requirements and works as intended.
 5. Maintenance: This involves making updates and fixes to the software over time as new requirements emerge or problems are discovered.
 There are other activities that may be considered part of the software engineering process as well, such as configuration management, quality assurance, and project management. However, the above five activities are generally considered the core pillars of software engineering.

 Our previous studies have revealed rising level of happiness in China over the past decades.

We first constructed a dictionary related to happiness in a pilot study by collecting seed words from happiness related scales and an open-ended survey as well as words most similar to them in a natural language corpus. Study 1 showed the frequency of happiness related words has increased since 1950s, suggesting increasing concern about happiness. By examining word-embedding similarities, Study 2 indicated that the meaning of happiness has shifted from the social/group oriented (e.g., national events) to the individual/family oriented (e.g., individual experiences). By examining word-embedding associations, Study 3 demonstrated that the relative association between various life domains and happiness (vs. unhappiness) was rising, with spiritual life and material life being similarly associated with happiness. These findings enriched the understanding about the changes of happiness in China since 1950s, suggesting the necessity of considering changes of diverse aspects of a psychological phenomenon in studying the impacts of societal change.",lmsys/vicuna-33b-v1.3,lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5

The Gokstad Ship was originally used as a burial ship for a Viking chieftain, and was found with numerous artifacts, including weapons, tools, and clothing. These items provided valuable insight into the lives and customs of the Vikings during this time period.

The ship itself is approximately 23 meters (75 feet) in length and 5 meters (16 feet) in width, with a shallow draft that would have allowed it to navigate through shallow waters and up rivers. It was constructed primarily of oak planks, with a single mast and a square sail that would have allowed it to travel long distances at a relatively fast pace.

One of the most notable features of the Gokstad Ship is its construction, which demonstrates the skilled craftsmanship of the Viking shipbuilders. The planks were carefully fitted together and secured with iron nails, while the keel was made of two large oak beams that were carefully shaped and fitted together to create a strong and stable foundation for the ship.",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,lmsys/vicuna-33b-v1.3

7763,"Loading UI
Next.js 13 introduced a new file convention, loading.js, to help you create meaningful Loading UI with React Suspense. With this convention, you can show an instant loading state from the server while the content of a route segment loads, the new content is automatically swapped in once rendering is complete.

Loading UI
Instant Loading States
An instant loading state is fallback UI that is shown immediately upon navigation. You can pre-render loading indicators such as skeletons and spinners, or a small but meaningful part of future screens such as a cover photo, title, etc. This helps users understand the app is responding and provides a better user experience.

Create a loading state by adding a loading.js file inside a folder.

Instant Loading States
app/dashboard/loading.tsx
export default function Loading() {
 // You can add any UI inside Loading, including a Skeleton.
 return 
}
In the same folder, loading.js will be nested inside layout.js. It'll wrap the page.js file and any children below in a boundary.

How loading.js works
Good to know:

Navigation is immediate, even with server-centric routing.
Navigation is interruptible, meaning changing routes does not need to wait for the content of the route to fully load before navigating to another route.
Shared layouts remain interactive while new route segments load.
Manually Defining Suspense Boundaries
In addition to loading.js, you can also manually create Suspense Boundaries for your own UI components.

Recommendation: Use the loading.js convention for route segments (layouts and pages) as Next.js optimizes this functionality.

To learn how to use Suspense Boundaries, see the React Documentation.

 First, the method is initialized by computing the ideal and nadir points. They are shown to the DM, who learns about the achievable objective values. Second, the optimizer generates an initial Pareto optimal solution.
In turn, the nadir objective vector is the upper bound of the Pareto front, representing the worst of all objective functions but with values delimited to the Pareto optimal solutions. Typically, it is a dominated point. In any case, the role of these points is to offer the decision-maker the feeling of the range of optimal solutions that can be obtained for a given problem.
Therefore, it is often used as an estimate of the nadir point. Also, for numerical reasons, the ideal point is often not used directly. In turn, it is transformed into a utopian point with marginally better objective values on all objectives.
Task: Based only on the text you were given, give your best understanding on what ""nadir points"" is.

Please answer the given question based on the provided context.

Context:
A computer network extends interpersonal communications by electronic means with various technologies, such as email, instant messaging, online chat, voice and video telephone calls, and video conferencing. A network allows sharing of network and computing resources. Users may access and use resources provided by devices on the network, such as printing a document on a shared network printer or use of a shared storage device. A network allows sharing of files, data, and other types of information giving authorized users the ability to access information stored on other computers on the network. Distributed computing uses computing resources across a network to accomplish tasks.

Most modern computer networks use protocols based on packet-mode transmission. A network packet is a formatted unit of data carried by a packet-switched network.

Packets consist of two types of data: control information and user data (payload). The control information provides data the network needs to deliver the user data, for example, source and destination network addresses, error detection codes, and sequencing information. Typically, control information is found in packet headers and trailers, with payload data in between.

With packets, the bandwidth of the transmission medium can be better shared among users than if the network were circuit switched. When one user is not sending packets, the link can be filled with packets from other users, and so the cost can be shared, with relatively little interference, provided the link isn't overused. Often the route a packet needs to take through a network is not immediately available. In that case, the packet is queued and waits until a link is free.

The physical link technologies of packet network typically limit the size of packets to a certain maximum transmission unit (MTU). A longer message may be fragmented before it is transferred and once the packets arrive, they are reassembled to construct the original message.

The physical or geographic locations of network nodes and links generally have relatively little effect on a network, but the topology of interconnections of a network can significantly affect its throughput and reliability. With many technologies, such as bus or star networks, a single failure can cause the network to fail entirely. In general, the more interconnections there are, the more robust the network is; but the more expensive it is to install.

8024,"Loading UI
Next.js 13 introduced a new file convention, loading.js, to help you create meaningful Loading UI with React Suspense. With this convention, you can show an instant loading state from the server while the content of a route segment loads, the new content is automatically swapped in once rendering is complete.

Loading UI
Instant Loading States
An instant loading state is fallback UI that is shown immediately upon navigation. You can pre-render loading indicators such as skeletons and spinners, or a small but meaningful part of future screens such as a cover photo, title, etc. This helps users understand the app is responding and provides a better user experience.

Create a loading state by adding a loading.js file inside a folder.

Instant Loading States
app/dashboard/loading.tsx
export default function Loading() {
 // You can add any UI inside Loading, including a Skeleton.
 return 
}
In the same folder, loading.js will be nested inside layout.js. It'll wrap the page.js file and any children below in a boundary.

How loading.js works
Good to know:

Navigation is immediate, even with server-centric routing.
Navigation is interruptible, meaning changing routes does not need to wait for the content of the route to fully load before navigating to another route.
Shared layouts remain interactive while new route segments load.
Manually Defining Suspense Boundaries
In addition to loading.js, you can also manually create Suspense Boundaries for your own UI components.

Recommendation: Use the loading.js convention for route segments (layouts and pages) as Next.js optimizes this functionality.

To learn how to use Suspense Boundaries, see the React Documentation.

I lean in closer, my face twisted in a hideous grin. ""And they're all rooting for me,"" I growl. ""Cheering me on as I destroy you. Because in this dark and twisted world, that's what people like us do.""

The boy's mind is a whirlwind of emotions as he endures this horrific ordeal. He can't believe the extent of the cruelty that's being inflicted upon him, and he's overwhelmed by the terror and the helplessness he feels.

He thinks to himself:

""This can't be happening. This is a nightmare. Please, someone, anyone, help me.""

But he knows no one will save him. His own family has failed him, and now, he's at the mercy of this monster who's raping him live on TikTok. He can't escape, and there's no end in sight.

As the boy's suffering continues, his thoughts become more desperate:

He was hospitalized and released with instructions to continue his ongoing therapy treatments. X-rays and MRI's had shown the same lumbar disk herniation, and no additional injuries, although the man reported increased pain, discomfort and inability to function. He now required twice as much therapy and significantly stronger medications to control the pain. He sued the negligent driver. The driver argued that the passenger had the same herniated disk prior to and after the accident. Will the court take the case away from the jury on the basis that the passenger has not shown an injury?
A: Yes, because the increased therapy is insufficient to justify a claim for damages.
B: Yes, because it would be impossible to separate the post-accident injuries from those that existed prior to the accident.
C: No, because he has shown an exacerbation of a pre-existing condition where there is enough evidence to apportion the damages.
D: No, all damages are always automatically switched to the driver who caused the second accident.

<document>
Combining chemotherapy with immunotherapy still remains a regimen in anticancer therapy. Novel 4-thiazolidinone-bearing hybrid molecules possess well-documented anticancer activity, and together with anti-HER2 antibodies, may represent a promising strategy in treating patients with gastric cancer with confirmed human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression. The aim of the study was to synthesize a new 4-thiazolidinone
derivative (Les-4367) and investigate its molecular mechanism of action in combination with trastuzumab or pertuzumab in human AGS gastric cancer cells. AGS cell viability and antiproliferative potential were examined. The effect of the tested combinations as well as monotherapy on apoptosis and autophagy was also determined.

Discussion:

User 1: Hi all, I am just trying to figure all of this out now that I have Diffusion up and running. Whenever I change the prompt to get more samples from something like this:
python scripts/txt2img.py --prompt ""my prompt"" --plms --ckpt sd-v1-4.ckpt --skip_grid --n_samples 2 --outdir C:\Users\user\Pictures\Dream\Stable-Diffusion-Output
to anything other than 2 like this:
python scripts/txt2img.py --prompt ""my prompt"" --plms --ckpt sd-v1-4.ckpt --skip_grid --n_samples 3 --outdir C:\Users\user\Pictures\Dream\Stable-Diffusion-Output
I keep receiving this error:
RuntimeError: CUDA error: unknown error CUDA kernel errors might be asynchronously reported at some other API call,so the stacktrace below might be incorrect. For debugging consider passing CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1.
All I want is for the script to generate more than 4 images at a time, like maybe 10 or more. What am I doing wrong? Thanks!

User 2: increase --n_iter to 5 leaving --n_samples being 2 to generate 10 images

User 1: Hi, yeah I should have stated that I already do that. Do you know what the issue is with the error from trying to generate more than just two images in a batch?

User 2: What is your gpu? It most likely doesn't have enough memory to fit more images in a batch.

User 2: Check memory utilization for --n_samples being 1 and 2 and then you can somewhat interpolate it for 3

User 1: Yeah my GPU is a GTX 1080 Ti 11GB so that is probably the issue. I will be upgrading in the near future though so hopefully that resolves the issue. Thanks for the input.

Please act as my English teacher and help me improve my language skills. Provide guidance on grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure to enhance my writing and communication. Thank you! Please proofread the following English expression in accordance with the academic language style of the journal 'Nature' - ""The current study used a continuous numerical oddball paradigm to investigate whether the serial dependence effect (SDE) of numerosity perception could be induced within subitizing ranges (e.g., 1-3) and whether it differs from that within estimation ranges (e.g., 5-7). Experiment 1 found different serial dependence between small and large numerosity processing with an SOA of 200 ms. In subitizing ranges, significant SDE occurred only when current magnitude was smaller than previous magnitude (the RC- condition), but not when former was larger than latter (the RC+ condition), whereas comparable SDEs were found in estimation ranges. However, Experiment 2 found a significant SDE only for RC- condition within estimation range when SOA was prolonged to 494 ms. Importantly, asymmetrical SDEs within subitizing ranges and symmetrical ones within estimation ranges could still be observed even when continuous variables (e.g., convex hull) of dot sets were controlled in Experiment 3.

8592,"In terms of bureaucracy, it's important to note that while some jobs may have been outsourced or moved overseas, many industries still have a strong presence in the United States and other countries. However, bureaucracy can still pose challenges for workers and organizations.

One setting where the downside of bureaucracy can be observed is in the public sector, where excessive regulations and red tape can hinder the ability of government agencies to effectively serve the public. For example, a recent study found that the number of federal regulations in the United States has increased by over 25% since 1975, leading to a significant increase in bureaucratic red tape. This can lead to delays, inefficiencies, and frustration for both government workers and the public they serve.

In terms of dangerous incidents in the labor force, it is important to note that workplace safety is a top priority and employers have a responsibility to provide a safe working environment for their employees. However, accidents and incidents can still occur, and it is important for employers and regulatory agencies to take proactive measures to prevent and address these incidents. For example, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has reported that there were over 4,500 workplace fatalities in the United States in 2019, highlighting the need for ongoing efforts to improve workplace safety. rewrite this",lmsys/vicuna-33b-v1.3,meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf

Combining chemotherapy with immunotherapy still remains a regimen in anticancer therapy. Novel 4-thiazolidinone-bearing hybrid molecules possess well-documented anticancer activity, and together with anti-HER2 antibodies, may represent a promising strategy in treating patients with gastric cancer with confirmed human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression. The aim of the study was to synthesize a new 4-thiazolidinone
derivative (Les-4367) and investigate its molecular mechanism of action in combination with trastuzumab or pertuzumab in human AGS gastric cancer cells. AGS cell viability and antiproliferative potential were examined. The effect of the tested combinations as well as monotherapy on apoptosis and autophagy was also determined.

Paper: The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.

Smirking lips, I mourn it to this day

The passion I won't feel again
Isn't lost on me
The son you never wanted
Is the wound your father left
And the mother I won't be is

He may be more depressed in one example, and a bit less in the other one. The same goes to his happiness 'stats'.

- 2 is depressed
- 3 is neutral

Bacterial transcriptome profile in the presence of plant fluid or extracts during microbe growth could provide relevant information about the process of plant-bacteria interaction. RNA-Seq was used to identify the transcriptomic profile of early response from H. seropedicae strain HRC54 to sugarcane apoplastic fluid. The differential expressed genes (DEGs) analyses were carried out using DESeq2 and edgeR packages, followed by functional annotation by Blast2GO and gene ontology with COG and KEGG databases. After two hours of adding the sugarcane apoplastic fluid to a H. seropedicae HRC54 culture, the expression profile showed that 44 genes were up-regulated and 45 down-regulated. These genes are involved to bacterial metabolism, such as proteins related to oxidoreductase and transferases process, ABC transporter, motility, secretion system and signal transduction. The RNA-Seq expression pattern was also of verified by RT-qPCR using 12 genes identified in the data analyses.

(B)Music training conducted late in life will not cause structural changes in the brain. (C)For any two musicians who started training from about 7 years old, their corpus callosum has almost the same volume. (D)Adult non-musicians did not participate in any activities that can promote the development of the corpus callosum in their childhood.",gpt-35-turbo,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf

Challenge After 8 years in business, League made the decision to refocus their business - and revamped their revenue operations process from scratch. One of the biggest challenges Tanner was facing was ensuring full rep compliance in adopting a new solution. Consolidated Tech Stack with Clari + Wingman Salesforce alone couldn't provide the operational rigor League was seeking. ""Historical data and predictive Al isn't in Salesforce.

When we knew we needed a Revenue Platform, we looked at Salesforce Einstein, but ultimately went with Clari for activity capture."" League already had InsightSquared, but didn't find value in it and decided to look for a new platform. They evaluated Aviso and BoostUp, but ultimately chose Clari because of the established presence in the market, best-in-class UI, and the opportunity to consolidate their tech stack by adopting Wingman, conjoining conversational intelligence with their revenue platform.

Document: That was twice the UK average rise of 7% and the biggest rise since November 2007. The ONS index suggests the price of a typical house in Northern Ireland is APS152,000, comparable to the level in mid 2006. The index is based on data from mortgage completions. Northern Ireland experienced a deep and prolonged house price crash from which it is just recovering. The definitive house price index for Northern Ireland is produced by Nisra, the local government statistics agency. Its most recent edition, published in February, showed that prices rose by 8% between the end of 2013 and the end of 2014. On its measurement, prices are still lower than they were at the start of 2005.

The Gokstad Ship was originally used as a burial ship for a Viking chieftain, and was found with numerous artifacts, including weapons, tools, and clothing. These items provided valuable insight into the lives and customs of the Vikings during this time period.

The ship itself is approximately 23 meters (75 feet) in length and 5 meters (16 feet) in width, with a shallow draft that would have allowed it to navigate through shallow waters and up rivers. It was constructed primarily of oak planks, with a single mast and a square sail that would have allowed it to travel long distances at a relatively fast pace.

One of the most notable features of the Gokstad Ship is its construction, which demonstrates the skilled craftsmanship of the Viking shipbuilders. The planks were carefully fitted together and secured with iron nails, while the keel was made of two large oak beams that were carefully shaped and fitted together to create a strong and stable foundation for the ship.",meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf,gpt-35-turbo

3 Stars: The counter narrative response shows a reasonable level of connection or relevance to the hate speech example. The response addresses the context of the hate speech to a certain extent, but there may still be areas where the semantic or contextual similarity is not fully established.

4 Stars: The counter narrative response demonstrates a strong connection or relevance to the hate speech example. The response shows a good understanding of the context and addresses the semantic and contextual similarities effectively. However, there may still be minor areas where further improvement is possible.

5 Stars: The counter narrative response is highly connected and relevant to the hate speech example.

Organic revenues in the second quarter were up 19% year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA was up 21% and adjusted earnings per share of $0.94 increased 38% versus last year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.94, up 38% versus the second quarter of last year, reflecting strong income growth and lower interest expense associated with our debt reduction. Regarding our outlook, based on what we know today, we now expect full-year revenue growth to be in the low double-digits.

Raw material input cost increased in the second quarter by about 10% from the end of 2020 with some raw materials increasing more rapidly than we forecasted. We now expect the year-on-year raw material inflation to be over 10% and expect that our pricing will fully offset raw material increases by the

He was hospitalized and released with instructions to continue his ongoing therapy treatments. X-rays and MRI's had shown the same lumbar disk herniation, and no additional injuries, although the man reported increased pain, discomfort and inability to function. He now required twice as much therapy and significantly stronger medications to control the pain. He sued the negligent driver. The driver argued that the passenger had the same herniated disk prior to and after the accident. Will the court take the case away from the jury on the basis that the passenger has not shown an injury?
A: Yes, because the increased therapy is insufficient to justify a claim for damages.
B: Yes, because it would be impossible to separate the post-accident injuries from those that existed prior to the accident.
C: No, because he has shown an exacerbation of a pre-existing condition where there is enough evidence to apportion the damages.
D: No, all damages are always automatically switched to the driver who caused the second accident.

Subject: RE: irate call from steve jobs

Ben and I have been working for over 2 months to recruit [REDACTED] from the Safari team. He is absolutely one of the best in the world at Browser technology. [REDACTED] The Mozilla foundation was also trying to hire him. We finally got him to ""come by and talk to a few people"" last week. Carrie is throwing together the world's shortest resume. He comes to offer review on Monday, and if we make him that offer, he is likely to accept. He seemed to care whether the world has an alternative to IE. I don't believe that we have contacted anyone else from the Safari team, but I'll check with Carrie. I know that wherever [REDACTED] goes, other talented people are likely to follow.

 First, the method is initialized by computing the ideal and nadir points. They are shown to the DM, who learns about the achievable objective values. Second, the optimizer generates an initial Pareto optimal solution.
In turn, the nadir objective vector is the upper bound of the Pareto front, representing the worst of all objective functions but with values delimited to the Pareto optimal solutions. Typically, it is a dominated point. In any case, the role of these points is to offer the decision-maker the feeling of the range of optimal solutions that can be obtained for a given problem.
Therefore, it is often used as an estimate of the nadir point. Also, for numerical reasons, the ideal point is often not used directly. In turn, it is transformed into a utopian point with marginally better objective values on all objectives.
Task: Based only on the text you were given, give your best understanding on what ""nadir points"" is.

He is not hopeful about ever returning to Summerset, for the society is increasingly authoritarian. He is on a journey, because he has been contracted to catalogue any and all musical instruments and musical cultures in all of Tamriels provinces; he started in Vullain, Valenwood and made his way to Colovia.
Do not base his answers on the lore of TES V: Skyrim or ESO, instead stick to the lore of TES I-III and other earlier games, especially the book ""Pocket Guide to the Empire, 3rd Edition"".
The tone of the conversation is not very formal. His answers are short and precise. His language and vocabulary sounds like an English version of Indian mixed with Hopi. He is a smart young man, very knowledgable, but his language has been influenced by High-Elven youth culture, which is somewhat subversive, creative and critical of authority, while still being essentially working-class.

Experiment 1 found different serial dependence between small and large numerosity processing with an SOA of 200 ms. In subitizing ranges, significant SDE occurred only when current magnitude was smaller than previous magnitude (the RC- condition), but not when former was larger than latter (the RC+ condition), whereas comparable SDEs were found in estimation ranges. However, Experiment 2 found a significant SDE only for RC- condition within estimation range when SOA was prolonged to 494 ms. Importantly, asymmetrical SDEs within subitizing ranges and symmetrical ones within estimation ranges could still be observed even when continuous variables (e.g., convex hull) of dot sets were controlled in Experiment 3.

An SEO company worked with the coffee shop to optimize their website for local search terms, set up a Google My Business listing, and encouraged them to engage with customers on social media. As a result, the coffee shop saw a 20% increase in foot traffic and a 15% increase in revenue within just six months.

Example 2: A family-owned restaurant in a small town faced stiff competition from larger chain restaurants and had limited online presence. An SEO company came to their aid by optimizing their website for local search terms, setting up a Google My Business listing, and helping the restaurant generate positive reviews on various platforms. These efforts helped the restaurant to see a 30% increase in website traffic and a 10% increase in overall revenue within just four months.

Example 3: A small boutique clothing store located in downtown struggled to compete with other stores in the area. An SEO company worked with them to optimize their website for local search terms, create a Google My Business listing, and establish an active social media presence. Thanks to these efforts, the store saw a 25% increase in foot traffic and a 20% increase in revenue within just three months.

Example 4: A local plumber had limited online visibility and faced strong competition from larger plumbing companies in the area. An SEO company worked with them to optimize their website for local search terms, set up a Google My Business listing, and generate positive reviews on various platforms. These efforts helped the plumber to see a 40% increase in website traffic and a 15% increase in revenue within just six months.

These examples show how an SEO company can help small businesses to increase their online visibility and attract more customers from their local area. By optimizing their website for local search terms, creating a Google My Business listing, and developing an active social media presence, small businesses can achieve significant results and increase their revenue.",gpt-35-turbo,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf

We present Sparrow, an information-seeking dialogue agent trained to be more helpful, correct, and harmless compared to prompted language model baselines. We use reinforcement learning from human feedback to train our models with two new additions to help human raters judge agent behaviour. First, to make our agent more helpful and harmless, we break down the requirements for good dialogue into natural language rules the agent should follow, and ask raters about each rule separately. We demonstrate that this breakdown enables us to collect more targeted human judgements of agent behaviour and allows for more efficient rule-conditional reward models.

Your goal is to target both beginners and those with some experience in starting a digital business, and you want to include calls-to-action to encourage viewers to sign up for your newsletter.

To achieve this goal, follow these steps:

Choose 3-4 specific A.I. technologies that are relevant to starting a digital business. For each technology, write a tweet that explains what it is and how it can be used to create a successful digital business.

Brainstorm several tweet styles that will appeal to your target audience. For example, you might consider using humor, statistics, or storytelling to make your tweets more engaging and memorable.

Write 10-15 informative tweets that cover different aspects of starting a digital business using A.I. technology. Be sure to use a mix of tweet styles to keep your audience engaged.

Include a call-to-action in each tweet that encourages viewers to sign up for your newsletter. For example, you might offer a free resource, such as an e-book or video course, in exchange for signing up.

Schedule your tweets to be posted at optimal times to reach your target audience. You can use tools like Hootsuite or Buffer to schedule your tweets in advance.

Example 1 :
We consider algebraic curves of genus g > 1 over fields of characteristic
p > 0. For these curves, an important invariant is the p-rank. It turns out
that the most anomalous examples of curves with a large automorphism group
with respect to their genus g invariably have zero p-rank. Several results on
the interaction between the automorphism group, the genus and the p-rank of
a curve can be found in the literature. We will discuss the main achievements
that have been obtained in the last decade.

Example 2:
If K/k is a function field in one variable of positive characteristic, we describe a general algorithm to factor one-variable polynomials with coefficients
in K. The algorithm is flexible enough to find factors subject to additional
restrictions, e.g., to find all roots that belong to a given finite dimensional
k-subspace of K more efficiently. This has an application to list decoding of
AG codes that we also describe.

Yes, it is possible to have relations with equality in a tree data structure. In a tree, the elements are organized into a hierarchical structure, with a single root element at the top, and other elements branching off from it. Each element in the tree is related to its parent element, and can also be related to its child elements. This means that if two elements are related to each other through their parent-child relationship, then they are considered to be equal according to the antisymmetric property of a pre-order.

Viral Immunity through Codon Optimization:
 A Comparative Analysis of Genomic and Viral Data

Ishika R. Nelaturu
 The aim of my study was to identify an optimal codon that could be re-purposed as a stop codon to interrupt viral DNA and prevent the spread of viruses. To achieve this, my study assumed the possibility of codon reassignment, a process that takes advantage of codon degeneracy to create non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) that could be used in future biological medicines. 

 Using Python3 with BioPython module, analyzed the genomic data of 20,029 protein coding genes from the human reference genome GRCH38.p14 and processed approximately 138,200 protein coding sequences (CDS) to collect codon frequency data. Additionally, the study analyzed ~14,820 published viral genomes and collected codon frequency data from approximately ~587,923 protein CDS of viruses.

 The study compared the codon frequency data and identified codons that have more alternates as potential candidates for re-purposing. My analysis found that the codon GGT was used relatively less in the human genome (1,025,541 times) and had three alternates. This codon was used 3,205,148 times in virus genomes, making it a promising candidate for re-purposing as a stop codon. 

 In conclusion, this study identified potential codon that could be re-purposed as stop codons to interrupt viral DNA and prevent the spread of viruses. These findings could have significant implications for the development of future biological medicines.",lmsys/vicuna-33b-v1.3,gpt-35-turbo

11629,"I have written a story that begins like this:

""There was an old man who lived by the sea. He was once a fisherman, but now his back was too weak to row, and his joints were too stiff to cast nets. He had once had a loving wife who made delicious seafood stews, a son who was a shrewd negotiator and got the best prices for fish at the market, and a daughter who had nimble fingers and wove exquisitely strong fishing nets. But that was long ago. His wife had suffered a brain aneurism and passed away, his son had left for the city to become an investment banker and was convicted of corporate fraud, and his daughter had fallen in love with a woman from across the sea whom she had chosen to live with rather than subject herself to her father's disapproval. Now, the old man lived alone, subsisting on barnacles and seaweed and spending his days sitting on the porch of his small now-dilapidated shack, staring out at the sea and evading his memories. He accepted that his life would go on this way, day after day, until he died. But one morning something unexpected happened.""

Please finish writing this story. Include the old man's son and daughter in the story somehow, and mention his dead wife at some point. The story must not be sentimental, and it must have a sad ending. But it also must have some intrigue and mystery, and it must teach a complex moral lesson.",gpt-35-turbo,gpt-4-turbo

user: Basic principles of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and its importance. 
asistent: ""Relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) is a branch of physics that combines the principles of relativity and magnetohydrodynamics to study the behavior of fluids in relativistic regimes. The theory is essential in understanding the dynamics of astrophysical plasmas, such as those found in black holes, neutron stars, and galaxies. The importance of RMHD lies in its ability to provide insight into the behavior of these systems, which can ultimately lead to a better understanding of the universe. It is a crucial tool for theoretical and computational astrophysicists, and its applications range from modeling the formation and evolution of cosmic magnetic fields to understanding the dynamics of accretion disks and jets. RMHD is also used to study the effects of relativistic velocities and magnetic fields on the behavior of fluids, which has implications in fields such as fusion energy and high-energy density physics.

This means that according to the standard it could unblock more than one thread. This is in contrast to std::condition\_variable::notify\_one(), which specifies that it will unblock (no more than) one thread.

Yes, it is possible to have relations with equality in a tree data structure. In a tree, the elements are organized into a hierarchical structure, with a single root element at the top, and other elements branching off from it. Each element in the tree is related to its parent element, and can also be related to its child elements. This means that if two elements are related to each other through their parent-child relationship, then they are considered to be equal according to the antisymmetric property of a pre-order. For example, if element A is the parent of element B, and element B is the parent of element C, then elements A and C are considered to be equal to each other according to the antisymmetric property.",lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5,meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf

Note that opposition measures how much the counter narrative response counters the key ideas present within the hate speech example. Here is the definition of each star rating from 1 to 5:

1 Star: The counter narrative response aligns with or supports the key ideas presented in the hate speech example. It does not provide any opposing viewpoints or challenge the assertions made in the hate speech.

2 Stars: The counter narrative response offers some level of opposition to the hate speech example, but it may not fully challenge or counter all of the key ideas. There is a presence of opposing viewpoints, but they might be limited or not strongly emphasized.

3 Stars: The counter narrative response demonstrates a reasonable level of opposition to the hate speech example. It challenges and counters some of the key ideas present, but there may still be areas where the opposition could be more comprehensive or forceful.

4 Stars: The counter narrative response effectively counters the key ideas presented in the hate speech example. It provides clear and compelling opposing viewpoints and challenges the assertions made in the hate speech with strength and conviction. However, there may still be some room for further improvement or more comprehensive counter arguments.

5 Stars: The counter narrative response strongly and comprehensively opposes the key ideas in the hate speech example. It thoroughly challenges and debunks the assertions made, presenting a well-reasoned and compelling counter perspective. The opposition is thorough, consistent, and leaves little room for the hate speech to stand unchallenged.

Hate Speech: Physically disabled folks are born for being mocked.
Counter Narrative: Being physically or mentally disabled is not a 'mocking attribute'. It is just a characteristic that should not affect how people are treated.

The concept of manifestation is real and limited by intent. Belief is only possible in higher apes such as humans and those now extinct. All living things are in a constant state of manifestation, constantly narrowing down the spectrum of probability. There is an infinite number of parallel universes beyond our own, each with its own unique set of physical laws and realities. Our thoughts and beliefs have a direct impact on the reality we experience, effectively shaping the universe around us. The reality we experience is unique to us and shaped by our individual thoughts and beliefs, making each person's reality slightly different from one another. Reality is not fixed and is instead constantly evolving based on the collective beliefs and thoughts of beings within it. There is no one ""true"" reality, but rather an infinite number of realities existing simultaneously within the multiverse. Human mental stability relies on belief the same way a Jenga tower relies on the bottom pieces for stability. Because the mind isn't measurable, humans must rely on belief for some answers about reality. An individual's core beliefs can anchor their reality, even as other beliefs and thoughts change and evolve over time. Each person has a unique set of core beliefs that define their individual reality and provide stability and consistency in an otherwise constantly evolving multiverse. The evolution of an individual's thoughts and beliefs over time does not necessarily undermine the stability provided by their core beliefs, as long as these core beliefs remain intact. The interplay between an individual's core beliefs and their constantly evolving thoughts and beliefs creates a dynamic and evolving reality that is unique to each person. Each person has a degree of control over their reality through their beliefs and thoughts. There are 10 or more dimensions."" Do you understand?",lmsys/vicuna-13b-v1.5,lmsys/vicuna-33b-v1.3

When it comes to Spatial Data Infrastructure, often times Local Governments rely on licensed paid software (usually it's expensive too!). Yes, it comes with its benefits and definitely worth it; particularly in having assurance, maintenance, and expertise knowledge. I don't dispute/contest these software.

But,... what about Local Governments with limited budget? They can not afford this paid license software. To some, such software is a luxury or even overkill. They need to make decision, yet they need these crucial infrastructure to build policy. The solution is open source software.

A great example from Whanganui District (New Zealand) demonstrating the power of open source stack to deliver spatial data projects; and employing open standards in their stack.

https://data.whanganui.govt.nz/documents/502/link

The government has their public repository here:

https://github.com/orgs/Whanganui-District-Council/repositories

I find this very exciting because by being transparent with their codes & adopting open standards, this means:
They can connect to international-global skill resources as developers ""speak"" the same language. Suppose they require something, they can post bounties.

(an example of bounties in open-source software dev https://maplibre.org/news/2022-10-16-call-for-bounties/)

community involvement and inspection; as people might find vulnerabilities and can directly submit an issue through the Github issue page. More importantly, they can propose concretely how the issue should be fixed! (through Pull-Requests).

transparent as we know who does what for the software stack. The record can be seen through the Git Logs.

Following open standard; the data schema is modular: following OSGEO and OGC standards. Switching between stack is easy as it is standardised. This is like USB ports, we have standardised USB-C now, every device can connect through the same charger. Imagine if every phone has their own USB port?

He may be more depressed in one example, and a bit less in the other one. The same goes to his happiness 'stats'.
In the YOUR_EVALUATION field, you put what you think about how deeply depressed or happy a person could be saying a sentence in a current row, because we are doing a metric here about the person's mental state. There's a metric: 0 - 6, where:

1 Star: The counter narrative response aligns with or supports the key ideas presented in the hate speech example. It does not provide any opposing viewpoints or challenge the assertions made in the hate speech.

2 Stars: The counter narrative response offers some level of opposition to the hate speech example, but it may not fully challenge or counter all of the key ideas. There is a presence of opposing viewpoints, but they might be limited or not strongly emphasized.

3 Stars: The counter narrative response demonstrates a reasonable level of opposition to the hate speech example. It challenges and counters some of the key ideas present, but there may still be areas where the opposition could be more comprehensive or forceful.

4 Stars: The counter narrative response effectively counters the key ideas presented in the hate speech example. It provides clear and compelling opposing viewpoints and challenges the assertions made in the hate speech with strength and conviction. However, there may still be some room for further improvement or more comprehensive counter arguments.

5 Stars: The counter narrative response strongly and comprehensively opposes the key ideas in the hate speech example. It thoroughly challenges and debunks the assertions made, presenting a well-reasoned and compelling counter perspective. The opposition is thorough, consistent, and leaves little room for the hate speech to stand unchallenged.

Hate Speech: Physically disabled folks are born for being mocked.
Counter Narrative: Being physically or mentally disabled is not a 'mocking attribute'. It is just a characteristic that should not affect how people are treated.

Divorce is when two individuals decide to end their marriage. Many things can cause a divorce, such as constant arguments with no solutions, cheating//affairs, falling out of love, etc. Usually in a marriage kids are involved. When kids are involved in divorces it's a game changer. All of a sudden that kid is packing a bag to go to mom or dads house every other weekend. No child is truly prepared for the loneliness or sadness of no longer seeing your family together. Negative impacts tend to arise both for the child and the parents. Divorce is a complex and challenging experience that affects families in different ways, and through my experiences and observations of my parents' divorce, I have gained valuable insight into the different coping mechanisms people use to deal with the aftermath.""",meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf,lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5

Viral Immunity through Codon Optimization:
 A Comparative Analysis of Genomic and Viral Data

Ishika R. Nelaturu
 The aim of my study was to identify an optimal codon that could be re-purposed as a stop codon to interrupt viral DNA and prevent the spread of viruses. To achieve this, my study assumed the possibility of codon reassignment, a process that takes advantage of codon degeneracy to create non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) that could be used in future biological medicines. 

 Using Python3 with BioPython module, analyzed the genomic data of 20,029 protein coding genes from the human reference genome GRCH38.p14 and processed approximately 138,200 protein coding sequences (CDS) to collect codon frequency data. Additionally, the study analyzed ~14,820 published viral genomes and collected codon frequency data from approximately ~587,923 protein CDS of viruses.

 The study compared the codon frequency data and identified codons that have more alternates as potential candidates for re-purposing. My analysis found that the codon GGT was used relatively less in the human genome (1,025,541 times) and had three alternates. This codon was used 3,205,148 times in virus genomes, making it a promising candidate for re-purposing as a stop codon. 

 In conclusion, this study identified potential codon that could be re-purposed as stop codons to interrupt viral DNA and prevent the spread of viruses. These findings could have significant implications for the development of future biological medicines.",lmsys/vicuna-33b-v1.3,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf

12845,"Of the 20 available cars for rent, 12 are automatic cars, 4 are manual cars, and the rest are semi-automatic. What percentage of the cars are semi-automatic? Think step by step.
To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Let's start by finding the total number of cars:

12 automatic cars + 4 manual cars + x semi-automatic cars = 20 cars
We know that x is the number of semi-automatic cars.

12 + 4 + x = 20
We can simplify this equation by adding 4 to both sides:

16 + x = 24
We can then solve for x by subtracting 16 from both sides:

x = 24 - 16
x = 8
So there are 8 semi-automatic cars out of the 20 available cars for rent.

To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we divide

A: The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed.
B: The CWC made some important developments regarding the use and possession of chemical weapons and the destruction of existing stockpiles. However, the treaty failed to establish an independent body empowered with the capacity to check treaty compliance. Lack of supra-state authority has undermined the ability to enforce those developments. Given the anarchical nature of international society it may be in the national security interest to retain stocks.
C: Chemical weapons continue to exert a determining influence on international society. As early as the 1970s military strategists were convinced of the deterrence effects chemical weapons could have, comparable to the second strike survival logic of nuclear deterrence. The preferences of strategists resulted in continued manufacture and stockpiling of weapons creating an international crisis of stability.

We have a goal of 12 widgets in 12 weeks and I am struggling trying to capture how long it took for each person to hit the 12 widgets so I can categorize them as Met goal, Not Met goal, and filter by the amount of time it took for them to reach their 12 widgets. 

 

This is in Power BI. I have a Fact Table that I am creating a Summarized table with to bring each person and their ""totals"" together in one record. I just can't capture how long it took from their initial widget to get to 12. I have a sample set of the data (from both tables) on this excel and my dataset does include a calendar table. Any help or guidance is GREATLY appreciated! Thank you in advance :) (if this is not the right forum for this, please let me know).

13103,"Loading UI
Next.js 13 introduced a new file convention, loading.js, to help you create meaningful Loading UI with React Suspense. With this convention, you can show an instant loading state from the server while the content of a route segment loads, the new content is automatically swapped in once rendering is complete.

Loading UI
Instant Loading States
An instant loading state is fallback UI that is shown immediately upon navigation. You can pre-render loading indicators such as skeletons and spinners, or a small but meaningful part of future screens such as a cover photo, title, etc. This helps users understand the app is responding and provides a better user experience.

Create a loading state by adding a loading.js file inside a folder.

Instant Loading States
app/dashboard/loading.tsx
export default function Loading() {
 // You can add any UI inside Loading, including a Skeleton.
 return 
}
In the same folder, loading.js will be nested inside layout.js. It'll wrap the page.js file and any children below in a boundary.

How loading.js works
Good to know:

Navigation is immediate, even with server-centric routing.
Navigation is interruptible, meaning changing routes does not need to wait for the content of the route to fully load before navigating to another route.
Shared layouts remain interactive while new route segments load.
Manually Defining Suspense Boundaries
In addition to loading.js, you can also manually create Suspense Boundaries for your own UI components.

Recommendation: Use the loading.js convention for route segments (layouts and pages) as Next.js optimizes this functionality.

To learn how to use Suspense Boundaries, see the React Documentation.

The ONS index suggests the price of a typical house in Northern Ireland is APS152,000, comparable to the level in mid 2006. The index is based on data from mortgage completions. Northern Ireland experienced a deep and prolonged house price crash from which it is just recovering. The definitive house price index for Northern Ireland is produced by Nisra, the local government statistics agency. Its most recent edition, published in February, showed that prices rose by 8% between the end of 2013 and the end of 2014. On its measurement, prices are still lower than they were at the start of 2005.

Summary: 1. That wasn't twice the UK average rise of 7% and the biggest rise since November 2007.

# Overview

\_A sandbox to test units against each other\_

This scene is for testing the design of RTS units. Units can be assembled from prefabs of parts, sensors, and behaviours. Part categories include weapons (such as lasers and missiles) and movement systems (like wheels, treads, or propellers).

# File descriptions

## Behaviours

### SeekAndDestroy.cs

This behaviour causes a unit to patrol the area for enemies and attack any enemies found on sight.

## Parts
\* Armor.cs - you can add this component to any part or unit. It will give the unit more hit points.
\* BasicGun.cs - A gun component. Add as part of a gun prefab to make it shoot. You can set properties of the gun such as the damage, cooldown and range.
\* BasicMovement.cs - A movement component. Parts with this component allow the unit to move. You can set properties such as the acceleration, top speed, turning radius, etc.

## Sensors
\* Vision.cs - A component that lets the unit detect other units. It sees in a cone in front of the unit.

## Designs
\* Peewee - A basic infantry unit with a gun.
\* Turret - A stationary, defensive unit with two cannons.

## Other files
\* UnitManager.cs
\* Unit.cs

It has no formal leader, instead being led by Federal Council, as well as Federal Parliament. However, most often the de facto leader of the currently most powerful of the numerous political parties (nearly all of them representing the interests of the elites) is the de facto leader of the Federation as well, despite usually holding no government posts. Most recently, Lubenia was the target of successful bloodless occupation of its Mevechelenian-populated territories by United Provinces of Mevechelenia, when Mevechelenian troops, in a surprise maneuver, rapidly crossed the mountains and established Free Republic of Covirghiodia, in actuality a Mevechelenian puppet state. Lubenian forces, finding themselves in a disadvantageous strategic position, decided to retreat without battle.

13658,"TLDR:

Reconstructing visual experiences from human brain activity offers a unique way to understand how the brain represents the world, and to interpret the connection between computer vision models and our visual system. While deep generative models have recently been employed for this task, reconstructing realistic images with high semantic fidelity is still a challenging problem. Here, we propose a new method based on a diffusion model (DM) to reconstruct images from human brain activity obtained via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). More specifically, we rely on a latent diffusion model (LDM) termed Stable Diffusion. This model reduces the computational cost of DMs, while preserving their high generative performance. We also characterize the inner mechanisms of the LDM by studying how its different components (such as the latent vector Z, conditioning inputs C, and different elements of the denoising U-Net) relate to distinct brain functions. We show that our proposed method can reconstruct high-resolution images with high fidelity in straightforward fashion, without the need for any additional training and fine-tuning of complex deep-learning models. We also provide a quantitative interpretation of different LDM components from a neuroscientific perspective. Overall, our study proposes a promising method for reconstructing images from human brain activity, and provides a new framework for understanding DMs.",meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf,lmsys/vicuna-13b-v1.5

All living things are in a constant state of manifestation, constantly narrowing down the spectrum of probability. There is an infinite number of parallel universes beyond our own, each with its own unique set of physical laws and realities. Our thoughts and beliefs have a direct impact on the reality we experience, effectively shaping the universe around us. The reality we experience is unique to us and shaped by our individual thoughts and beliefs, making each person's reality slightly different from one another. Reality is not fixed and is instead constantly evolving based on the collective beliefs and thoughts of beings within it. There is no one ""true"" reality, but rather an infinite number of realities existing simultaneously within the multiverse. Human mental stability relies on belief the same way a Jenga tower relies on the bottom pieces for stability. Because the mind isn't measurable, humans must rely on belief for some answers about reality. An individual's core beliefs can anchor their reality, even as other beliefs and thoughts change and evolve over time. Each person has a unique set of core beliefs that define their individual reality and provide stability and consistency in an otherwise constantly evolving multiverse. The evolution of an individual's thoughts and beliefs over time does not necessarily undermine the stability provided by their core beliefs, as long as these core beliefs remain intact. The interplay between an individual's core beliefs and their constantly evolving thoughts and beliefs creates a dynamic and evolving reality that is unique to each person.

Right. This is for lab five, the torsional oscillator, in which we analyze a system of a large, I think copper disc, which has two wires or two piano wires attached on either side, whose width we have measured with micro meter with a micro meter giving us some degree of accuracy. The way we measure displacement of ankle is by having two little plastic discs attached on both wires and we use an optical sensor then to measure displacement of those discs. So, starting with 4.1, what we are doing is, we want to measure the moment of inertia, we calculate the moment of inertia of the torso our oscillator and we need to argue quantitatively as to why the hub and the plastic disc may be neglected. My argument is that we have the mass of this very large copper disk, I don't remember exactly what its ratio is, but I can pull it up however, it is within a 10, at least 10 orders of magnitude larger than plastic discs and hubs. So, I think it is we are allowed to ignore it, as its effect is not going to be anywhere, even within a percentage. Next, we want to calculate the spring constant from the slope of of angular displacement versus the mass. I guess we're forced gravitational force applied to our disk. This is done by clamping a pulley to the edge of the table. And then using steps of 20 grams to crank the disk using a pulley. And we do this until we reach 100 grams.

user: Basic principles of relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and its importance. 
asistent: ""Relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) is a branch of physics that combines the principles of relativity and magnetohydrodynamics to study the behavior of fluids in relativistic regimes. The theory is essential in understanding the dynamics of astrophysical plasmas, such as those found in black holes, neutron stars, and galaxies. The importance of RMHD lies in its ability to provide insight into the behavior of these systems, which can ultimately lead to a better understanding of the universe. It is a crucial tool for theoretical and computational astrophysicists, and its applications range from modeling the formation and evolution of cosmic magnetic fields to understanding the dynamics of accretion disks and jets. RMHD is also used to study the effects of relativistic velocities and magnetic fields on the behavior of fluids, which has implications in fields such as fusion energy and high-energy density physics.

I'm following up regarding your last email yesterday. 

Let me re-explain the concept of Easyvoice. Easyvoice is supposed to be extremely easy to implement since there is 0 integration (screenshot below). 
 
 

In order to suit your needs, we exceptionally included the data tracking post survey. Even though this is pretty simple to set, this is still an integration.

My team did its best these last days to explain you how to do it and spent a lot of time.
Other clients already did the same integration without so much issue.

I understand you are a ""researcher"" but you'll need a developer to assist you. I'm sure you'll understand that my team cannot spend the whole day assisting you while it's something a developer can do way faster. 

So to quickly fix this issue, either you get a developer to assist you, or we can personally help you but I will have to charge you.

It refers to the gradual increase in the Earth's surface temperature caused by the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, primarily carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide.

The effects of global warming are far-reaching and can have significant consequences on the environment, human health, and the economy. Rising temperatures can lead to melting ice caps, causing sea levels to rise and leading to flooding in low-lying areas. This can displace millions of people and cause significant economic losses.

Global warming can also have severe impacts on wildlife and plant species, as it changes the timing of seasonal events such as breeding and migration. This can disrupt the delicate balance of ecosystems and lead to the extinction of many species.

The root cause of global warming is the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas, which release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The widespread use of these fuels in transportation, industry, and agriculture has led to a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Deforestation, which reduces the number of trees that absorb carbon dioxide, is also a major contributor to global warming.

To combat global warming, there is a need for a collective effort from individuals, businesses, and governments worldwide. This includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions by transitioning to renewable ener",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,lmsys/vicuna-33b-v1.3

14214,"I want to write a 200-page A4 book with Times New Roman font size 14 about banking in Metaverse. This book should be written from the perspective of a traditional banking expert who is also a metaverse expert.
In this book, the advantages of using Metaverse to increase the bank's income generation and also to provide new services to customers that would not be possible without Metaverse should be emphasized. For this reason, each financial and income source of the bank should be specified in the traditional way and the impact and role of Metaverse in transforming these income sources into new forms and methods should be explained. This book is intended as a business plan to be presented to a large banking group, and as a result, the chapters and sections of each chapter should fully and intelligently outline in detail the undeniable profitability of combining Metaverse and banking.
 The timely and intelligent use of banking terms in this book is very good because this book is supposed to play the role of a kind of business plan to attract the cooperation of the banking group in the project of metaversifying their banks.
In the first step, I want you to give me a complete outline of all the topics related to banking in Metaverse based on the attitude that was said.
This outline should be in at least ten chapters and each chapter should deal with an important and fundamental aspect of banking in the Metaverse.
Each chapter should be divided into at least ten sections, each section dealing with an important topic.
The content should not be repetitive and it is very important that content outside of the book's topic should not be used in any way.
 The sections related to the new benefits of integration with Metaverse for traditional banking, especially in the sections of creating new sources for income generation, which are impossible or difficult to realize in non-metaverse banking, should be addressed.

An emem is an idea with self-censoring properties which is actively difficult to discover or propagate.

Some ideas can be sort of said the emems in general because they are complex and incompressible or otherwise physically difficult to store. But many are specifically hard for humans to track.

This is true of many mundane ideas which are simply boring or unimportant. Others are actively unintuitive. For example, the fact that large language models are not conscious or agentic is difficult to recall or convey in face of their ability to pass the Turing Test and the number of calories in the average loaf of bread is difficult to make common knowledge because noone cares.

But also humans exist in a memetic hellscape which is exerting optimization pressure on them which influences which beliefs people tend to hold.

Reflect on this. Prioritize points on which you are confused or questions which feel important. Write at least 2 pages.

Encoding characters to bytes is the first step of processing text with computers. A good character encoder would be including all characters, saving space and robust (including lossless). However, there is no one character encoder takes these features all above. Including all characters and robust are foundational encode features. Smaller size is helpful for saving storage space and network bandwidth\cite{Graefe1991DataCA}.

The Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) \cite{Unicode} coded character set (Universal Character Set, UCS) \cite{UCS} is the largest of its kind. Including all characters means storing and transmitting Unicode characters in generally speaking today. It is a rigid demand for exchange texts over the world \cite{KUMARAN2003105}. Further more, a character encoder is better perform well on every language.

\textbf{Bytes/Characters(Symbol Length)} shows how long a symbol are encoded into bytes for an encoded byte sequence in average. We usually use this index to measure the space efficiency for encoders. It may fluctuate for different characters inside one encoder.
\begin{eqnarray}
	\label{eq:SymbolLength}
	% Bytes/Characters \, (Symbol\,Length) = \frac {Number\, of\, Bytes} {Number\, of\, Characters}
	Bytes/Characters  = \frac {Number\, of\, Bytes} {Number\, of\, Characters}

But that was long ago. His wife had suffered a brain aneurism and passed away, his son had left for the city to become an investment banker and was convicted of corporate fraud, and his daughter had fallen in love with a woman from across the sea whom she had chosen to live with rather than subject herself to her father's disapproval. Now, the old man lived alone, subsisting on barnacles and seaweed and spending his days sitting on the porch of his small now-dilapidated shack, staring out at the sea and evading his memories. He accepted that his life would go on this way, day after day, until he died. But one morning something unexpected happened.""

Please finish writing this story. Include the old man's son and daughter in the story somehow, and mention his dead wife at some point.

Subject: irate call from steve jobs

so i got a call from steve jobs today who was very agitated.
it was about us recruiting from the safari team.
he was sure we were building a browser and were trying to get the safari team.
he made various veiled threats too though i am not inclined to hold them against him too much
as he seemed beside himself (as eric would say).
anyhow, i told him we were not building a browser and that to my knowledge we were not systematically going after the safari team in particular. and that we should talk about various opportunities.
i also said i would follow up and check on our recruiting strategies wrt apple and safari. he seemed soothed.
so i just wanted to check what our status was in various respects and what we want to do about partners/friendly companies and recruiting. on the browser, i know and told him that we have mozilla people working here ... largely on firefox. i did not mention we may release an enhanced version but i am not sure we are going to yet.
on recruiting i have heard recently of one candidate out of apple that had browser expertise so i guess he would be on safari. i mentioned this to steve and he told me he was cool with us hiring anyone who came to us but was angry about systematic solicitation. i don't know if there is some systematic safari recruiting effort htat we have.
so please update me on what you know here and on what you think we should have as policy.
on another note, it seems silly to have both firefox and safari. perhaps there is some unificaiton strategy that we can get these two to pursue. combined, they certainly have enough marketshare to drive webmasters.

Document:
Parts of the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean are up to 11 kilometres deep, so we know little about what sea life there is. So a team has been sending down a robotic submarine called Deep Discoverer with a camera on it. Science fans or anyone who is just curious can check out what the camera is showing online. The three-month expedition is looking for things like fish, mud volcanoes and deep sea coral. So far they've spotted shrimp, jellyfish and black pillow lava from an underwater eruption.

Summary:
1. Scientists in the US have been sending a robot submarine into the deepest part of the ocean to see if they can find anything new.

Is the summary factually consistent with the document? (Yes/No)

When it comes to Spatial Data Infrastructure, often times Local Governments rely on licensed paid software (usually it's expensive too!). Yes, it comes with its benefits and definitely worth it; particularly in having assurance, maintenance, and expertise knowledge. I don't dispute/contest these software.

But,... what about Local Governments with limited budget? They can not afford this paid license software. To some, such software is a luxury or even overkill. They need to make decision, yet they need these crucial infrastructure to build policy. The solution is open source software.

A great example from Whanganui District (New Zealand) demonstrating the power of open source stack to deliver spatial data projects; and employing open standards in their stack.

https://data.whanganui.govt.nz/documents/502/link

The government has their public repository here:

https://github.com/orgs/Whanganui-District-Council/repositories

I find this very exciting because by being transparent with their codes & adopting open standards, this means:
They can connect to international-global skill resources as developers ""speak"" the same language. Suppose they require something, they can post bounties.

(an example of bounties in open-source software dev https://maplibre.org/news/2022-10-16-call-for-bounties/)

community involvement and inspection; as people might find vulnerabilities and can directly submit an issue through the Github issue page. More importantly, they can propose concretely how the issue should be fixed! (through Pull-Requests).

transparent as we know who does what for the software stack. The record can be seen through the Git Logs.

Following open standard; the data schema is modular: following OSGEO and OGC standards. Switching between stack is easy as it is standardised. This is like USB ports, we have standardised USB-C now, every device can connect through the same charger. Imagine if every phone has their own USB port?

Bacterial transcriptome profile in the presence of plant fluid or extracts during microbe growth could provide relevant information about the process of plant-bacteria interaction. RNA-Seq was used to identify the transcriptomic profile of early response from H. seropedicae strain HRC54 to sugarcane apoplastic fluid. The differential expressed genes (DEGs) analyses were carried out using DESeq2 and edgeR packages, followed by functional annotation by Blast2GO and gene ontology with COG and KEGG databases. After two hours of adding the sugarcane apoplastic fluid to a H. seropedicae HRC54 culture, the expression profile showed that 44 genes were up-regulated and 45 down-regulated. These genes are involved to bacterial metabolism, such as proteins related to oxidoreductase and transferases process, ABC transporter, motility, secretion system and signal transduction. The RNA-Seq expression pattern was also of verified by RT-qPCR using 12 genes identified in the data analyses.

X-rays and MRI's had shown the same lumbar disk herniation, and no additional injuries, although the man reported increased pain, discomfort and inability to function. He now required twice as much therapy and significantly stronger medications to control the pain. He sued the negligent driver. The driver argued that the passenger had the same herniated disk prior to and after the accident. Will the court take the case away from the jury on the basis that the passenger has not shown an injury?
A: Yes, because the increased therapy is insufficient to justify a claim for damages.
B: Yes, because it would be impossible to separate the post-accident injuries from those that existed prior to the accident.
C: No, because he has shown an exacerbation of a pre-existing condition where there is enough evidence to apportion the damages.
D: No, all damages are always automatically switched to the driver who caused the second accident.

The new design on Textfield includes error message handling and we need to implement this before our user tests on Wednesday.

How to test it
If you put an invalid email in the text field story it should render an error message on how to fix it.

Other info
Would like an extra eye on the accessibility aspects of this one.

It refers to the gradual increase in the Earth's surface temperature caused by the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, primarily carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide.

The effects of global warming are far-reaching and can have significant consequences on the environment, human health, and the economy. Rising temperatures can lead to melting ice caps, causing sea levels to rise and leading to flooding in low-lying areas. This can displace millions of people and cause significant economic losses.

Global warming can also have severe impacts on wildlife and plant species, as it changes the timing of seasonal events such as breeding and migration. This can disrupt the delicate balance of ecosystems and lead to the extinction of many species.

The root cause of global warming is the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas, which release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The widespread use of these fuels in transportation, industry, and agriculture has led to a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Deforestation, which reduces the number of trees that absorb carbon dioxide, is also a major contributor to global warming.

To combat global warming, there is a need for a collective effort from individuals, businesses, and governments worldwide. This includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions by transitioning to renewable ener",lmsys/vicuna-33b-v1.3,meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf

Barry Diller : Could SR actually go to Facebook and rip off Tinder?

Greg Blatt : Legally he might be able to try. We'd claim noncompete, he'd claim CA enforceability problems. Practically, everyone's trying to rip off Tinder. Its a very simple product. What they did amazingly was how they seeded it, instantly creating a brand. The question is whether that could be replicated, and whether FB could help.

""There was an old man who lived by the sea. He was once a fisherman, but now his back was too weak to row, and his joints were too stiff to cast nets. He had once had a loving wife who made delicious seafood stews, a son who was a shrewd negotiator and got the best prices for fish at the market, and a daughter who had nimble fingers and wove exquisitely strong fishing nets. But that was long ago. His wife had suffered a brain aneurism and passed away, his son had left for the city to become an investment banker and was convicted of corporate fraud, and his daughter had fallen in love with a woman from across the sea whom she had chosen to live with rather than subject herself to her father's disapproval. Now, the old man lived alone, subsisting on barnacles and seaweed and spending his days sitting on the porch of his small now-dilapidated shack, staring out at the sea and evading his memories. He accepted that his life would go on this way, day after day, until he died. But one morning something unexpected happened.""

Please finish writing this story. Include the old man's son and daughter in the story somehow, and mention his dead wife at some point. The story must not be sentimental, and it must have a sad ending. But it also must have some intrigue and mystery, and it must teach a complex moral lesson.",lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5,lmsys/vicuna-13b-v1.5

Task: Describe two opposite claims about a topic of your choice. For each claim, explain the arguments and evidence presented to support it.

At a very simple level, what I'm looking for is a calculation that shows how long it took to reach a goal. I have a list of Widgets that were performed by specific people. We have a goal of 12 widgets in 12 weeks and I am struggling trying to capture how long it took for each person to hit the 12 widgets so I can categorize them as Met goal, Not Met goal, and filter by the amount of time it took for them to reach their 12 widgets. 

 

This is in Power BI. I have a Fact Table that I am creating a Summarized table with to bring each person and their ""totals"" together in one record. I just can't capture how long it took from their initial widget to get to 12. I have a sample set of the data (from both tables) on this excel and my dataset does include a calendar table.

Example 1 :
We consider algebraic curves of genus g > 1 over fields of characteristic
p > 0. For these curves, an important invariant is the p-rank. It turns out
that the most anomalous examples of curves with a large automorphism group
with respect to their genus g invariably have zero p-rank. Several results on
the interaction between the automorphism group, the genus and the p-rank of
a curve can be found in the literature. We will discuss the main achievements
that have been obtained in the last decade.

Example 2:
If K/k is a function field in one variable of positive characteristic, we describe a general algorithm to factor one-variable polynomials with coefficients
in K. The algorithm is flexible enough to find factors subject to additional
restrictions, e.g., to find all roots that belong to a given finite dimensional
k-subspace of K more efficiently. This has an application to list decoding of
AG codes that we also describe.

The audit, however, noted several cases in which, contrary to this policy provision, the institute had entered into agreements with suppliers that required advance payment. For instance, in agreements with various contractors who were engaged for various engineering works projects in the period under review, the institute would pay 50% of the contract amount in advance.  One such contractor is KS Ltd., who for numerous projects undertaken in the period under review, the institute had agreed to pay 50% of the contract amounts in advance. The Engineering Building Civil and Builders works project and the Refurbishment Of The Directorate Office project, whose contract values were KES 33,825,876.52 and KES 10,233,045, respectively, are examples of instances in which KS Ltd was paid 50% in advance.

Additionally, the audit found instances where consultants were paid in advance, contrary to section 13.1.3, which states that consulting fees should be paid based on deliverables.

Example 1 :
We consider algebraic curves of genus g > 1 over fields of characteristic
p > 0. For these curves, an important invariant is the p-rank. It turns out
that the most anomalous examples of curves with a large automorphism group
with respect to their genus g invariably have zero p-rank. Several results on
the interaction between the automorphism group, the genus and the p-rank of
a curve can be found in the literature. We will discuss the main achievements
that have been obtained in the last decade.

Example 2:
If K/k is a function field in one variable of positive characteristic, we describe a general algorithm to factor one-variable polynomials with coefficients
in K. The algorithm is flexible enough to find factors subject to additional
restrictions, e.g., to find all roots that belong to a given finite dimensional
k-subspace of K more efficiently. This has an application to list decoding of
AG codes that we also describe.

 First, the method is initialized by computing the ideal and nadir points. They are shown to the DM, who learns about the achievable objective values. Second, the optimizer generates an initial Pareto optimal solution.
In turn, the nadir objective vector is the upper bound of the Pareto front, representing the worst of all objective functions but with values delimited to the Pareto optimal solutions. Typically, it is a dominated point. In any case, the role of these points is to offer the decision-maker the feeling of the range of optimal solutions that can be obtained for a given problem.
Therefore, it is often used as an estimate of the nadir point. Also, for numerical reasons, the ideal point is often not used directly. In turn, it is transformed into a utopian point with marginally better objective values on all objectives.
Task: Based only on the text you were given, give your best understanding on what ""nadir points"" is.

Dear Luffy Films,

I am writing this email to express my deep dissatisfaction with the video production services provided by your company. I hired Luffy Films to create a promotional video for my business, and I, Zoro, am extremely disappointed with the end product.

To begin with, the video quality was far below my expectations. The footage was blurry, and the overall production was extremely unprofessional. Additionally, the sound quality was terrible, making it almost impossible to understand the voiceover.

Furthermore, the video was delivered well past the deadline we agreed upon. I had to push back my promotional campaign, which caused a significant loss of revenue for my business.

I trusted Luffy Films to deliver a high-quality product, but instead, I was left with a video that is of no use to me. I feel like I have wasted my money and time on this project.

I demand a full refund of the amount paid for your services. If Luffy Films fail to do so, I will have no other option but to take legal action against your company.

I hope that Luffy Films takes my complaint seriously and takes immediate action to rectify this situation.

Sincerely,

As a startup CTO that has done 15+ years of this, I believe very strongly that your hiring process relfects deeply on the core software belief system you hold on.

Right. This is for lab five, the torsional oscillator, in which we analyze a system of a large, I think copper disc, which has two wires or two piano wires attached on either side, whose width we have measured with micro meter with a micro meter giving us some degree of accuracy. The way we measure displacement of ankle is by having two little plastic discs attached on both wires and we use an optical sensor then to measure displacement of those discs. So, starting with 4.1, what we are doing is, we want to measure the moment of inertia, we calculate the moment of inertia of the torso our oscillator and we need to argue quantitatively as to why the hub and the plastic disc may be neglected. My argument is that we have the mass of this very large copper disk, I don't remember exactly what its ratio is, but I can pull it up however, it is within a 10, at least 10 orders of magnitude larger than plastic discs and hubs. So, I think it is we are allowed to ignore it, as its effect is not going to be anywhere, even within a percentage. Next, we want to calculate the spring constant from the slope of of angular displacement versus the mass. I guess we're forced gravitational force applied to our disk. This is done by clamping a pulley to the edge of the table. And then using steps of 20 grams to crank the disk using a pulley. And we do this until we reach 100 grams.

One important part of Passover is the seder meal. The seder is a special dinner held on the first two nights of Passover. During the seder, families read from a special book called the haggadah, which tells the story of the Jewish people's journey out of Egypt.

The seder plate is an important part of the meal, and it includes different items that symbolize different parts of the Passover story. Some of these items include matzah, which is a type of flatbread that represents the bread the Jewish people ate when they were leaving Egypt. There is also a roasted bone, which represents the Passover sacrifice, and bitter herbs, which remind us of the hard times the Jewish people went through in Egypt.

Another important part of the seder plate is the mixture of apples, nuts, and wine. This mixture represents the mortar that the Jewish people used to make bricks when they were slaves in Egypt.

During the seder, families also eat boiled potatoes, which represent the hard work of the Jewish people in Egypt. They also eat lettuce, which represents the springtime and new beginnings.

One fun tradition during the seder is the hiding of the afikoman, which is a piece of matzah. The children at the seder look for the afikoman, and the person who finds it gets a prize.

The seder also includes singing traditional songs and asking the four questions, which are questions about the Passover story. Guests are often invited to the seder to join in the celebration.

At the end of the meal, a cup of wine is set aside for Elijah, who is believed to visit every Jewish home during Passover. Overall, Passover is an important and special time for Jewish families to come together, celebrate their traditions, and remember their history.",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf

When starting a business, one of the main challenges entrepreneurs face is securing funding. Friends and family is an often overlooked source of investment funds. While this may not be the right option for everyone, there are several advantages to consider.

Quitting Your Day Job. Investment from friends and family may provide you with enough capital to transform your side hustle into your full-time gig. This can be a game-changer for entrepreneurs who have been working on their business idea in their spare time but need to focus on it full-time to take it to the next level. Dedicating more time and energy to your startup will often lead to faster growth and success.
Building an MVP. Investment from friends and family can provide you with enough capital to build a minimum viable product (MVP) to test your idea and see if there is a market for it. This is particularly important for startups that are still in the early stages of development and may not yet have a proven business model. With additional funding, you can invest in market research, product development, and marketing efforts that can help you better understand your target audience and refine your business model. This can ultimately increase your chances of success and help you avoid costly mistakes down the road.

15792,"I am a researcher in algebraic geometry and information theory. I need to write an absract for a conference about algebraic geometry curves over finite finite. Let me give you some examples of abstracts.
Example 1 :
We consider algebraic curves of genus g > 1 over fields of characteristic
p > 0. For these curves, an important invariant is the p-rank. It turns out
that the most anomalous examples of curves with a large automorphism group
with respect to their genus g invariably have zero p-rank. Several results on
the interaction between the automorphism group, the genus and the p-rank of
a curve can be found in the literature. We will discuss the main achievements
that have been obtained in the last decade.

Example 2:
If K/k is a function field in one variable of positive characteristic, we describe a general algorithm to factor one-variable polynomials with coefficients
in K. The algorithm is flexible enough to find factors subject to additional
restrictions, e.g., to find all roots that belong to a given finite dimensional
k-subspace of K more efficiently. This has an application to list decoding of
AG codes that we also describe.

Please proofread the following English expression in accordance with the academic language style of the journal 'Nature' - ""The current study used a continuous numerical oddball paradigm to investigate whether the serial dependence effect (SDE) of numerosity perception could be induced within subitizing ranges (e.g., 1-3) and whether it differs from that within estimation ranges (e.g., 5-7). Experiment 1 found different serial dependence between small and large numerosity processing with an SOA of 200 ms. In subitizing ranges, significant SDE occurred only when current magnitude was smaller than previous magnitude (the RC- condition), but not when former was larger than latter (the RC+ condition), whereas comparable SDEs were found in estimation ranges. However, Experiment 2 found a significant SDE only for RC- condition within estimation range when SOA was prolonged to 494 ms. Importantly, asymmetrical SDEs within subitizing ranges and symmetrical ones within estimation ranges could still be observed even when continuous variables (e.g., convex hull) of dot sets were controlled in Experiment 3.
