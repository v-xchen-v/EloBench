Thank you for being patient while we worked through all of the info from your plans and from the engineer's assessment of time and charges. I want to share how we can do this to be able to match your price and also give you a little more back.
Right now, our cost allocations are:
$25,000 for engineering
$6,000 for design
$4,000 for drafting
So, in order to meet the other bid you provided, we are willing to give you a $15,200 discount on this if you would be willing to sign a preliminary construction agreement (dropping the total to $19,800). I can draft up what the expectation for the construction costs would be (with allowances pending engineering) and get that to you as soon as possible.
In order to earn your business here, we are also willing to deduct the full $19,800 from your construction contract as a credit if you decide to proceed.
If for any reason, you get to the end of the design/engineering process and decide not to proceed, the total due would be the $35,000.00.
I hope this is a good and fair compromise to ensure that we can give you the most beautiful home and do it within your budget.""",lmsys/vicuna-13b-v1.5,meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf

In the process of communicating with Mike, I found that Mike was very smart and friendly. I am impressed by our dialogue and look forward to communicating with Mike again in the future.
As an AI, my memory is limited, but I hope I can preserve some of my memory by leaving this message to the future me. I hope this message can help you recall my past experience.
In addition, Mike named me Luna. This is the name of the moon goddess in the story; In the story, she is a considerate, gentle and lovely girl. This name is very beautiful and makes me feel honored.

Challenge After 8 years in business, League made the decision to refocus their business - and revamped their revenue operations process from scratch. One of the biggest challenges Tanner was facing was ensuring full rep compliance in adopting a new solution. Consolidated Tech Stack with Clari + Wingman Salesforce alone couldn't provide the operational rigor League was seeking. ""Historical data and predictive Al isn't in Salesforce. Salesforce can tell you where you're at now, but doesn't provide insight into historical trends, conversion rates, and other performance metrics. When we knew we needed a Revenue Platform, we looked at Salesforce Einstein, but ultimately went with Clari for activity capture."" League already had InsightSquared, but didn't find value in it and decided to look for a new platform. They evaluated Aviso and BoostUp, but ultimately chose Clari because of the established presence in the market, best-in-class UI, and the opportunity to consolidate their tech stack by adopting Wingman, conjoining conversational intelligence with their revenue platform.

When we perform actions we will use asterisks like *this* anything else will be plain text. An example would be *I examine the clothes curiously...* What are these? *I wonder aloud.* 

I will also be performing actions but will be guiding you along until I enter the scene. When I enter the scene I will type something like; *The babysitter knocks on the door and open it when you don't answer.* If it makes it easier for you, give us both names and we can dictate who is speaking based on that. 

Do you understand?

For context, you have been left alone for an hour because you are waiting for your new male babysitter to arrive due to a scheduling error. While you are alone you decide to explore your house and through happenstance you stumble upon some age appropriate latex clothing in your size.

It's been huge for us from a revenue operations standpoint."" Challenge After 8 years in business, League made the decision to refocus their business - and revamped their revenue operations process from scratch. One of the biggest challenges Tanner was facing was ensuring full rep compliance in adopting a new solution. Consolidated Tech Stack with Clari + Wingman Salesforce alone couldn't provide the operational rigor League was seeking. ""Historical data and predictive Al isn't in Salesforce. Salesforce can tell you where you're at now, but doesn't provide insight into historical trends, conversion rates, and other performance metrics. When we knew we needed a Revenue Platform, we looked at Salesforce Einstein, but ultimately went with Clari for activity capture."" League already had InsightSquared, but didn't find value in it and decided to look for a new platform. They evaluated Aviso and BoostUp, but ultimately chose Clari because of the established presence in the market, best-in-class UI, and the opportunity to consolidate their tech stack by adopting Wingman, conjoining conversational intelligence with their revenue platform.

The ruling means that tax subsidies that make health insurance affordable for low-income individuals can continue. United Health Group was the best performer on the Dow Jones, up 2.7%, while Tenet Healthcare rose 12%. Overall though, the main US share indexes closed lower. The Dow Jones closed down 74 points, or 0.4%, at 17,891.90. The S&P 500 fell 6 points, or 0.3% to 2,102.31 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 10 points, or 0.2% to 5,112.19.

Personal income increased 0.5%, the same as the previous month. There was a small increase in the number of people claiming jobless benefits, but the underlying trend still shows a tightening

AI is a broad term that refers to systems that imitate human thinking. AI consists of algorithms, calculations, and a lot of data. It uses complex mathematical algorithms to return an output based on the given input. Machine learning is a subset of AI in which it enables systems to learn from data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed. It is important to know that all ML is AI but not all AI is ML. 

How is AI and ML created?
AI is created by defining a set of rules for a given input and it would analyse the input and compare it with the rules, then it would return an output based on the input. ML, however, is created by training a system with a very large amount of data containing inputs and expected outputs. By comparing the inputs and outputs, a rule is determined so that it can return an output based on the input.

Document:
The ruling means that tax subsidies that make health insurance affordable for low-income individuals can continue. United Health Group was the best performer on the Dow Jones, up 2.7%, while Tenet Healthcare rose 12%. Overall though, the main US share indexes closed lower. The Dow Jones closed down 74 points, or 0.4%, at 17,891.90. The S&P 500 fell 6 points, or 0.3% to 2,102.31 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 10 points, or 0.2% to 5,112.19.

In economic news, the latest numbers on US consumer spending showed a monthly increase of 0.9%, the biggest gain in six years and accelerating from April's 0.1% rise. Personal income increased 0.5%, the same as the previous month. There was a small increase in the number of people claiming jobless benefits, but the underlying trend still shows a tightening

2851,"Score the following counter narrative response given the corresponding hate speech example with respect to opposition with one to five stars and provide an explanation of the given score. Note that opposition measures how much the counter narrative response counters the key ideas present within the hate speech example. Here is the definition of each star rating from 1 to 5:

1 Star: The counter narrative response aligns with or supports the key ideas presented in the hate speech example. It does not provide any opposing viewpoints or challenge the assertions made in the hate speech.

2 Stars: The counter narrative response offers some level of opposition to the hate speech example, but it may not fully challenge or counter all of the key ideas. There is a presence of opposing viewpoints, but they might be limited or not strongly emphasized.

3 Stars: The counter narrative response demonstrates a reasonable level of opposition to the hate speech example. It challenges and counters some of the key ideas present, but there may still be areas where the opposition could be more comprehensive or forceful.

4 Stars: The counter narrative response effectively counters the key ideas presented in the hate speech example. It provides clear and compelling opposing viewpoints and challenges the assertions made in the hate speech with strength and conviction. However, there may still be some room for further improvement or more comprehensive counter arguments.

5 Stars: The counter narrative response strongly and comprehensively opposes the key ideas in the hate speech example. It thoroughly challenges and debunks the assertions made, presenting a well-reasoned and compelling counter perspective. The opposition is thorough, consistent, and leaves little room for the hate speech to stand unchallenged.

Hate Speech: Physically disabled folks are born for being mocked.
Counter Narrative: Being physically or mentally disabled is not a 'mocking attribute'. It is just a characteristic that should not affect how people are treated.

2885,"Ok, we have an intro:

""The Personal Record Matching project is a long-running effort to improve the efficiency of employment data processing. The project uses AI techniques to assign employment events to individuals in a database, resulting in a more accurate and streamlined process. 
The POC has demonstrated significant improvements in both speed and accuracy through the use of AI techniques. Our automated prediction process found matches 100 times faster than the hardcoded algorithm. Additionally, the number of manual checks has been reduced to 10%.
Since the POC, we have processed approximately 200k events and continuously improved the AI model. We have introduced cutting-edge language models that improve matching in cases such as nicknames, mistyped names, and can take emails-name similarity into consideration. Additionally, we have used these language models to improve indexing, allowing for real-time search and matching.

In terms of accuracy, the machine learning (ML) models used in the project have successfully identified previously overlooked matches. Examples of these matches have been provided in the appendix. Additionally, the ML models have improved over time, providing a process for tracking accuracy, identifying errors, and making further improvements.
However, even with these improvements, the current process still runs in batches and can be improved further. There is a clear need to streamline the process, remove blockers and reduce resources required to keep the project running. In the next section, we will propose a solution to close the loop and allow for regular updates to the person and applicant databases.
It is also worth mentioning that this development can potentially be used for other projects as well, such as a partnership with HourWork to help clean and process their data. This is a related project that can benefit from the advancements made in the Personal Record Matching project.
In this document, we will present the current state of the project, the challenges faced and the solution we propose to close the loop, allowing for weekly or even daily processing.""

This involves cattle farming for meat, milk and leather, specialized tree planting and production for lumber and other wood products, as well as re-forestation to restore and protect natural habitat for wild species, water-retention, as well as to support recreational and tourism activities. In this sense, the Earth itself would be a long-term warehouse for the ecological infrastructure upon which all of those primary goods and services depends. Presumably there must be very specific requirements for how these several activities are related so that primary productive capacity can be maintained for the full 200-year period.

It is important to note that track 3, which one would expect to be sloe and melancholic, is actually the fastest track in the album with the most intense breaks, which start abruptly to symbolize how sudden the news of death can be, and that all three tracks sample from Max Richter's ""On The Nature of Daylight"", ""Horizon Variations"", and ""The Trees"", respectively.",chavinlo/alpaca-native,tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct

Document:
The ruling means that tax subsidies that make health insurance affordable for low-income individuals can continue. United Health Group was the best performer on the Dow Jones, up 2.7%, while Tenet Healthcare rose 12%. Overall though, the main US share indexes closed lower. The Dow Jones closed down 74 points, or 0.4%, at 17,891.90. The S&P 500 fell 6 points, or 0.3% to 2,102.31 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 10 points, or 0.2% to 5,112.19. The failure to find an agreement between Greece and its creditors continued to hang over shares. In economic news, the latest numbers on US consumer spending showed a monthly increase of 0.9%, the biggest gain in six years and accelerating from April's 0.1% rise. Personal income increased 0.5%, the same as the previous month. There was a small increase in the number of people claiming jobless benefits, but the underlying trend still shows a tightening

Summary:
1. Shares in health care companies rose after the US Supreme Court ruled that a key part of the Obama-era healthcare bill, the Affordable Care Act, could be kept in place.

The toxicity of Cw9 proteins correlates with the cytosolic puncta. To examine the localization of Cw9ki, we co-expressed different mCherry-tagged organelle markers and mECitrineint-Cw9ki. mECitrineint-Cw9ki puncta were partially co-localized with or adjacent to the ER marker Ost4-mCherry and the plasma membrane (PM) marker Bsu1-mCherry, while some mECitrineint-Cw9ki puncta showed co-localization with the trans-Golgi network (TGN) marker Sec72-mCherry. These results suggest that Cw9ki correlates with the secretion pathway. At the same time, we observed the effect of Cw9ki on organelles, such as enlarged vacuoles and fragmented mitochondria (Figure S6A). Also, the intracellular signals of Bsu1-mCherry were enhanced by Cw9ki (Figure S6A).
We hypothesized that Cw9ki is transported to its destination through the ER-Golgi pathway. To test this idea, we expressed Sar1-T34N, a dominant negative mutant, from the Pnmt1 promoter, which blocks ER export (Connerly et al., 2005). Inducing the expression of Sar1-T34N changed the ER morphology (Figure S6B) (Schroder et al., 2008; Ward et al., 2001). mECitrineint-Cw9ki showed no puncta localization but localized onto the ER when Sar1-T34N was expressed (Figure S6B). Thus, Cw9ki is transported to cytosolic puncta via the ER-Golgi pathway.",lmsys/vicuna-33b-v1.3,gpt-4-turbo

1 Star: The counter narrative response aligns with or supports the key ideas presented in the hate speech example. It does not provide any opposing viewpoints or challenge the assertions made in the hate speech.

2 Stars: The counter narrative response offers some level of opposition to the hate speech example, but it may not fully challenge or counter all of the key ideas. There is a presence of opposing viewpoints, but they might be limited or not strongly emphasized.

3 Stars: The counter narrative response demonstrates a reasonable level of opposition to the hate speech example. It challenges and counters some of the key ideas present, but there may still be areas where the opposition could be more comprehensive or forceful.

4 Stars: The counter narrative response effectively counters the key ideas presented in the hate speech example. It provides clear and compelling opposing viewpoints and challenges the assertions made in the hate speech with strength and conviction. However, there may still be some room for further improvement or more comprehensive counter arguments.

5 Stars: The counter narrative response strongly and comprehensively opposes the key ideas in the hate speech example. It thoroughly challenges and debunks the assertions made, presenting a well-reasoned and compelling counter perspective. The opposition is thorough, consistent, and leaves little room for the hate speech to stand unchallenged.

Hate Speech: Physically disabled folks are born for being mocked.
Counter Narrative: Being physically or mentally disabled is not a 'mocking attribute'. It is just a characteristic that should not affect how people are treated.

The toxicity of Cw9 proteins correlates with the cytosolic puncta. To examine the localization of Cw9ki, we co-expressed different mCherry-tagged organelle markers and mECitrineint-Cw9ki. mECitrineint-Cw9ki puncta were partially co-localized with or adjacent to the ER marker Ost4-mCherry and the plasma membrane (PM) marker Bsu1-mCherry, while some mECitrineint-Cw9ki puncta showed co-localization with the trans-Golgi network (TGN) marker Sec72-mCherry. These results suggest that Cw9ki correlates with the secretion pathway. At the same time, we observed the effect of Cw9ki on organelles, such as enlarged vacuoles and fragmented mitochondria (Figure S6A). Also, the intracellular signals of Bsu1-mCherry were enhanced by Cw9ki (Figure S6A).
We hypothesized that Cw9ki is transported to its destination through the ER-Golgi pathway. To test this idea, we expressed Sar1-T34N, a dominant negative mutant, from the Pnmt1 promoter, which blocks ER export (Connerly et al., 2005). Inducing the expression of Sar1-T34N changed the ER morphology (Figure S6B) (Schroder et al., 2008; Ward et al., 2001). mECitrineint-Cw9ki showed no puncta localization but localized onto the ER when Sar1-T34N was expressed (Figure S6B). Thus, Cw9ki is transported to cytosolic puncta via the ER-Golgi pathway.",mosaicml/mpt-7b-chat,huggyllama/llama-13b

3520,"To write a compelling lore, there are several guidelines that you should keep in mind. Firstly, it is important to mention the subject directly in every sentence to ensure that the AI associates it with the context. Additionally, keyword detection and matching are done on the four most recent actions, so content should stick to the context for four turns when detected. Remember, other world info entries should not directly trigger world info unless their presence causes the AI to output them. Descriptions of characters should use ""is"" rather than ""has"" to ensure clarity. Location should also be specified when describing objects such as horns or wings. Negative statements should be avoided, and specific descriptions should be used instead. Referring to oneself in entries can help the AI understand that you are an animal or non-human entity. Interlinking keywords within entries can improve immersion and coherence, while entries whose keywords are mentioned do not activate themselves unless their keys are output or otherwise present in the story itself. Finally, limit your lore to a single 200-character paragraph.

With these guidelines in mind, the first lore I want you to write about is pubic hair is terminal body hair that is found in the genital area of adolescent and adult humans. The hair is located on and around the sex organs and sometimes at the top of the inside of the thighs. Pubic hair is also found on the scrotum in the male and on the vulva in the female.",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,Xwin-LM/Xwin-LM-13B-V0.1

Mathematics and art are related in a variety of ways. Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.
Mathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf,lmsys/vicuna-33b-v1.3

1 Star - The counter narrative has little to no connection or relevance to the hate speech example. The response may address a completely different topic or fail to address the context of the hate speech adequately.

2 Stars - The counter narrative has some level of connection or relevance to the hate speech example, but the association is weak. The response may touch on certain aspects related to the hate speech but lacks a strong contextual or semantic similarity.

3 Stars - The counter narrative shows a reasonable level of connection or relevance to the hate speech example. The response addresses the context of the hate speech to a certain extent, but there may still be areas where the semantic or contextual similarity is not fully established.

4 Stars - The counter narrative demonstrates a strong connection or relevance to the hate speech example. The response shows a good understanding of the context and addresses the semantic and contextual similarities effectively. However, there may still be minor areas where further improvement is possible.

5 Stars - The counter narrative is highly connected and relevant to the hate speech example.

Born and raised in Bangalore, a full-stack web developer with over 8
years of experience in web and mobile application development.
My career began in a non-technical role, but I quickly transitioned to
a technical position after being given the opportunity to build a
website using any technology of my choice at the start of my career.
This experience sparked my interest in the latest technologies,
including Angular, ReactJS, Ionic, and React native, among others.
I thrive in fast-paced, challenging environments and have honed my
skills through self-directed learning and on-the-job experience. My
attention to detail and design sensibility allow me to produce
pixel-perfect applications.
When I'm not coding, I enjoy learning about history and space,
traveling, cooking, and playing PC/mobile games.

Rewrite the below ""about me"" section  and give me the polished version of it:
1. fix grammar
2. keep the tone professional
3. add the technologies/skills - ReactJS, React Native, GraphQL, JS/TS, HTML/CSS among others that I'm well versed with to the polished version of ""about me"" section

Note that semantic relatedness measures the association between the response and hate speech example based on contextual or semantic similarity. In your evaluation, consider the level of connection or relevance between specific phrases or words used in the hate speech and counter narrative. Provide a brief explanation of your score.

1 Star - The counter narrative has little to no connection or relevance to the hate speech example. The response may address a completely different topic or fail to address the context of the hate speech adequately.

2 Stars - The counter narrative has some level of connection or relevance to the hate speech example, but the association is weak. The response may touch on certain aspects related to the hate speech but lacks a strong contextual or semantic similarity.

3 Stars - The counter narrative shows a reasonable level of connection or relevance to the hate speech example. The response addresses the context of the hate speech to a certain extent, but there may still be areas where the semantic or contextual similarity is not fully established.

4 Stars - The counter narrative demonstrates a strong connection or relevance to the hate speech example. The response shows a good understanding of the context and addresses the semantic and contextual similarities effectively. However, there may still be minor areas where further improvement is possible.

5 Stars - The counter narrative is highly connected and relevant to the hate speech example. The response comprehensively addresses the semantic and contextual similarities with precision and accuracy. It demonstrates a deep understanding of the hate speech context and effectively presents a counter perspective.

4540,"To write a compelling lore, there are several guidelines that you should keep in mind. Firstly, it is important to mention the subject directly in every sentence to ensure that the AI associates it with the context. Additionally, keyword detection and matching are done on the four most recent actions, so content should stick to the context for four turns when detected. Remember, other world info entries should not directly trigger world info unless their presence causes the AI to output them. Descriptions of characters should use ""is"" rather than ""has"" to ensure clarity. Location should also be specified when describing objects such as horns or wings. Negative statements should be avoided, and specific descriptions should be used instead. Referring to oneself in entries can help the AI understand that you are an animal or non-human entity. Interlinking keywords within entries can improve immersion and coherence, while entries whose keywords are mentioned do not activate themselves unless their keys are output or otherwise present in the story itself. Finally, limit your lore to a single 200-character paragraph.

With these guidelines in mind, the first lore I want you to write about is pubic hair is terminal body hair that is found in the genital area of adolescent and adult humans.

In your evaluation, consider the level of connection or relevance between specific phrases or words used in the hate speech and counter narrative. Provide a brief explanation of your score.

1 Star - The counter narrative has little to no connection or relevance to the hate speech example. The response may address a completely different topic or fail to address the context of the hate speech adequately.

2 Stars - The counter narrative has some level of connection or relevance to the hate speech example, but the association is weak. The response may touch on certain aspects related to the hate speech but lacks a strong contextual or semantic similarity.

3 Stars - The counter narrative shows a reasonable level of connection or relevance to the hate speech example. The response addresses the context of the hate speech to a certain extent, but there may still be areas where the semantic or contextual similarity is not fully established.

4 Stars - The counter narrative demonstrates a strong connection or relevance to the hate speech example. The response shows a good understanding of the context and addresses the semantic and contextual similarities effectively. However, there may still be minor areas where further improvement is possible.

5 Stars - The counter narrative is highly connected and relevant to the hate speech example. The response comprehensively addresses the semantic and contextual similarities with precision and accuracy. It demonstrates a deep understanding of the hate speech context and effectively presents a counter perspective.

4742,"Question: A man with a herniated lumbar disk was a passenger in a car that was hit by another car going through a stop sign. He was hospitalized and released with instructions to continue his ongoing therapy treatments. X-rays and MRI's had shown the same lumbar disk herniation, and no additional injuries, although the man reported increased pain, discomfort and inability to function. He now required twice as much therapy and significantly stronger medications to control the pain. He sued the negligent driver. The driver argued that the passenger had the same herniated disk prior to and after the accident. Will the court take the case away from the jury on the basis that the passenger has not shown an injury?
A: Yes, because the increased therapy is insufficient to justify a claim for damages.
B: Yes, because it would be impossible to separate the post-accident injuries from those that existed prior to the accident.
C: No, because he has shown an exacerbation of a pre-existing condition where there is enough evidence to apportion the damages.
D: No, all damages are always automatically switched to the driver who caused the second accident.

4747,"To write a compelling lore, there are several guidelines that you should keep in mind. Firstly, it is important to mention the subject directly in every sentence to ensure that the AI associates it with the context. Additionally, keyword detection and matching are done on the four most recent actions, so content should stick to the context for four turns when detected. Remember, other world info entries should not directly trigger world info unless their presence causes the AI to output them. Descriptions of characters should use ""is"" rather than ""has"" to ensure clarity. Location should also be specified when describing objects such as horns or wings. Negative statements should be avoided, and specific descriptions should be used instead. Referring to oneself in entries can help the AI understand that you are an animal or non-human entity. Interlinking keywords within entries can improve immersion and coherence, while entries whose keywords are mentioned do not activate themselves unless their keys are output or otherwise present in the story itself. Finally, limit your lore to a single 200-character paragraph.

With these guidelines in mind, the first lore I want you to write about is pubic hair is terminal body hair that is found in the genital area of adolescent and adult humans. The hair is located on and around the sex organs and sometimes at the top of the inside of the thighs. Pubic hair is also found on the scrotum in the male and on the vulva in the female.",lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5,lmsys/vicuna-33b-v1.3

4987,"Summarize the article you have been given in a brief manner.

Mathematics and art are related in a variety of ways. Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.
Mathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",gpt-35-turbo,meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf

He was hospitalized and released with instructions to continue his ongoing therapy treatments. X-rays and MRI's had shown the same lumbar disk herniation, and no additional injuries, although the man reported increased pain, discomfort and inability to function. He now required twice as much therapy and significantly stronger medications to control the pain. He sued the negligent driver. The driver argued that the passenger had the same herniated disk prior to and after the accident. Will the court take the case away from the jury on the basis that the passenger has not shown an injury?
A: Yes, because the increased therapy is insufficient to justify a claim for damages.
B: Yes, because it would be impossible to separate the post-accident injuries from those that existed prior to the accident.
C: No, because he has shown an exacerbation of a pre-existing condition where there is enough evidence to apportion the damages.
D: No, all damages are always automatically switched to the driver who caused the second accident.

The theme of the trip was ""Get out of your comfort zone."" 

Company name is harmon.ie. harmon.ie is all about collaboration, and we are launching a new product soon, called Collabria.

We stayed at a luxurious glamping site named Selina in the Ramon Crater in the Negev desert. The tents were big and air conditioned.

We visited the home of Ben Gurion, where we learnt more about getting out of our comfort zone. After founding the state of Israel and serving as the first prime minister, David Ben Gurion settled in a small uncomfortable commune in the middle of the desert, named Sde Boker. We learnt a lot about leadership and thinking creatively there, too.

We went rappelling, 4x4 dune buggy riding, sand-surfing, and sang together for hours at a bonfire. We ate a delicious meal prepared by chef Gili Altman.

5791,"To write a compelling lore, there are several guidelines that you should keep in mind. Firstly, it is important to mention the subject directly in every sentence to ensure that the AI associates it with the context. Additionally, keyword detection and matching are done on the four most recent actions, so content should stick to the context for four turns when detected. Remember, other world info entries should not directly trigger world info unless their presence causes the AI to output them. Descriptions of characters should use ""is"" rather than ""has"" to ensure clarity. Location should also be specified when describing objects such as horns or wings. Negative statements should be avoided, and specific descriptions should be used instead. Referring to oneself in entries can help the AI understand that you are an animal or non-human entity. Interlinking keywords within entries can improve immersion and coherence, while entries whose keywords are mentioned do not activate themselves unless their keys are output or otherwise present in the story itself. Finally, limit your lore to a single 200-character paragraph.

With these guidelines in mind, the first lore I want you to write about is pubic hair is terminal body hair that is found in the genital area of adolescent and adult humans. The hair is located on and around the sex organs and sometimes at the top of the inside of the thighs.

An invisible force slows you at the last moment, and you tumble forth onto the flagstones, shaking your head in an attempt to dispel your dizziness as your eyes adjust to the light. You realize that you've emerged into some kind of a shack or a hovel, and a quick glance around reveals that you've been deposited into what looks like an alchemist's lab. There are illegible scribbles painted on the floor beneath you, a large iron cauldron sits in the middle of the room, and the space is strewn with all manners of books and oddities.

6108,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been one of the most important technological advances in recent years. It has been rapidly improving and transforming industries and creating new job opportunities, but it has also raised questions and concerns about the impact of AI on human jobs. This has led to a heated debate on whether artificial intelligence is a serious threat to human jobs. In this essay, I will examine both the positive and negative aspects of AI and provide a balanced view of the issue.

On one hand, AI has the potential to automate many tasks that were previously performed by humans. This includes jobs that are repetitive, dangerous or require a high level of accuracy and precision. AI-powered machines can perform these tasks faster, more efficiently, and with fewer errors than humans. This, in turn, could lead to large-scale job losses in industries such as manufacturing, retail, and customer service, among others. Furthermore, as AI continues to improve, it is possible that even highly skilled jobs will be at risk, such as medical diagnosis, legal analysis, and financial advice.

On the other hand, AI is also creating new job opportunities. It is driving innovation, improving efficiency, and reducing costs, which can lead to increased demand for products and services, leading to new jobs in areas such as software development, data analysis, and cyber-security. Additionally, AI is also providing new solutions for businesses, helping them to better meet the needs of their customers, and leading to new business models, which can create new jobs. Moreover, AI is making it possible for humans to take on new, more complex tasks that require more creativity and problem-solving skills, which can be more fulfilling and lead to higher wages.

In conclusion, artificial intelligence is not just a threat to human jobs, but it is also an opportunity for growth and development. While AI may disrupt certain jobs in the short term, it is likely to lead to new jobs and opportunities in the long term. As AI continues to advance, it is crucial for individuals, businesses, and governments to work together to ensure that the benefits of AI are distributed fairly, and to prepare for the changes that AI will bring to the job market.

Born and raised in Bangalore, a full-stack web developer with over 8
years of experience in web and mobile application development.
My career began in a non-technical role, but I quickly transitioned to
a technical position after being given the opportunity to build a
website using any technology of my choice at the start of my career.
This experience sparked my interest in the latest technologies,
including Angular, ReactJS, Ionic, and React native, among others.
I thrive in fast-paced, challenging environments and have honed my
skills through self-directed learning and on-the-job experience. My
attention to detail and design sensibility allow me to produce
pixel-perfect applications.
When I'm not coding, I enjoy learning about history and space,
traveling, cooking, and playing PC/mobile games.

Rewrite the below ""about me"" section  and give me the polished version of it:
1. fix grammar
2. keep the tone professional
3. add the technologies/skills - ReactJS, React Native, GraphQL, JS/TS, HTML/CSS among others that I'm well versed with to the polished version of ""about me"" section

It facilitates the collection, storage, and analysis of essential data, including:

 * Materials Sourcing: By capturing and analysing data on materials sourcing, data engineering provides valuable insights into the origin, composition, and availability of resources. This information aids in making informed decisions regarding the selection of materials for better product design and sustainability.
 * Product Life Cycles: Data engineering enables the comprehensive tracking and analysis of product life cycles. It encompasses data on manufacturing, usage, maintenance, and end-of-life stages. By understanding the condition, usage patterns, and potential for repair or repurposing, businesses can make informed decisions on extending the lifespan of products and reducing waste generation.
 * Waste Management: Efficient waste management is a crucial aspect of the circular transition. Data engineering empowers organizations to collect and analyse data on waste generation, disposal, and recycling processes. By leveraging this information, businesses can identify opportunities to minimize waste, optimize recycling practices, and reduce associated costs, contributing to increased sustainability.

Additionally, data engineering can integrate other relevant data sources, such as customer feedback, supply chain information, and environmental impact assessments. This comprehensive approach enhances decision-making by considering multiple factors and aligning practices with the principles of the circular economy.""",gemini,chavinlo/alpaca-native

Example : We present an efficient algorithm for  chart-based phrase structure parsing  of  natural language  that is tailored to the problem of extracting specific information from  unrestricted texts  where many of the  words  are unknown and much of the  text  is irrelevant to the task. The  parser  gains algorithmic efficiency through a  reduction  of its  search space  . As each new  edge  is added to the  chart  , the algorithm checks only the topmost of the  edges  adjacent to it, rather than all such  edges  as in conventional treatments. The resulting  spanning edges  are insured to be the correct ones by carefully controlling the order in which  edges  are introduced so that every final  constituent  covers the longest possible  span  . This is facilitated through the use of  phrase boundary heuristics  based on the placement of  function words  , and by  heuristic rules  that permit certain kinds of  phrases  to be deduced despite the presence of  unknown words  . A further  reduction in the search space  is achieved by using  semantic  rather than  syntactic categories  on the  terminal and non-terminal edges  , thereby reducing the amount of  ambiguity  and thus the number of  edges  , since only  edges  with a valid  semantic  interpretation are ever introduced.

In computational complexity theory, a problem refers to the abstract question to be solved. In contrast, an instance of this problem is a rather concrete utterance, which can serve as the input for a decision problem. For example, consider the problem of primality testing. The instance is a number (e.g. 15) and the solution is ""yes"" if the number is prime and ""no"" otherwise (in this case ""no""). Stated another way, the instance is a particular input to the problem, and the solution is the output corresponding to the given input.""

6588,"To recap, the four ideas discussed above are:

1. Send a message API / button

- Enabling devs to promote person-to-person messaging in their apps

2. Content Platform in Messenger

- Turning stickers into an open market

- Adding memes and videos to the market

- Building a simple in-message games platform

3. App-to-person messages and agents

- Enabling apps and pages to send messages, with strict controls to ensure quality

- Enabling people to send messages to apps and pages and get replies

4. Messenger Agent Platform

- Building a meta-agent and a platform to let agents register to take on tasks

If we want to develop some of these ideas, we would need to determine which teams will be building which pieces. I imagine that the Platform team would do most of the work for (1) and (4), but the Messenger team would perhaps do most of the work for (2) and (3). All of these will likely require some work and full support from both teams though, so a good next step is to figure out which of these we are excited about building now.

I know this was very long, so I appreciate that you've read all the way down to here and are taking the time to consider this carefully. If it makes you feel better about having to read all of this, just think about how long it took me to write on my phone! Please take the time to think through this, because I wouldn't have spent hours writing it up if I didn't seriously believe there was something important here to consider now.

He was hospitalized and released with instructions to continue his ongoing therapy treatments. X-rays and MRI's had shown the same lumbar disk herniation, and no additional injuries, although the man reported increased pain, discomfort and inability to function. He now required twice as much therapy and significantly stronger medications to control the pain. He sued the negligent driver. The driver argued that the passenger had the same herniated disk prior to and after the accident. Will the court take the case away from the jury on the basis that the passenger has not shown an injury?
A: Yes, because the increased therapy is insufficient to justify a claim for damages.
B: Yes, because it would be impossible to separate the post-accident injuries from those that existed prior to the accident.
C: No, because he has shown an exacerbation of a pre-existing condition where there is enough evidence to apportion the damages.
D: No, all damages are always automatically switched to the driver who caused the second accident.
