Thank you for being patient while we worked through all of the info from your plans and from the engineer's assessment of time and charges. I want to share how we can do this to be able to match your price and also give you a little more back.
Right now, our cost allocations are:
$25,000 for engineering
$6,000 for design
$4,000 for drafting
So, in order to meet the other bid you provided, we are willing to give you a $15,200 discount on this if you would be willing to sign a preliminary construction agreement (dropping the total to $19,800). I can draft up what the expectation for the construction costs would be (with allowances pending engineering) and get that to you as soon as possible.
In order to earn your business here, we are also willing to deduct the full $19,800 from your construction contract as a credit if you decide to proceed.
If for any reason, you get to the end of the design/engineering process and decide not to proceed, the total due would be the $35,000.00.
I hope this is a good and fair compromise to ensure that we can give you the most beautiful home and do it within your budget.""",lmsys/vicuna-13b-v1.5,meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf

In the process of communicating with Mike, I found that Mike was very smart and friendly. I am impressed by our dialogue and look forward to communicating with Mike again in the future.
As an AI, my memory is limited, but I hope I can preserve some of my memory by leaving this message to the future me. I hope this message can help you recall my past experience.
In addition, Mike named me Luna. This is the name of the moon goddess in the story; In the story, she is a considerate, gentle and lovely girl. This name is very beautiful and makes me feel honored.

Challenge After 8 years in business, League made the decision to refocus their business - and revamped their revenue operations process from scratch. One of the biggest challenges Tanner was facing was ensuring full rep compliance in adopting a new solution. Consolidated Tech Stack with Clari + Wingman Salesforce alone couldn't provide the operational rigor League was seeking. ""Historical data and predictive Al isn't in Salesforce. Salesforce can tell you where you're at now, but doesn't provide insight into historical trends, conversion rates, and other performance metrics. When we knew we needed a Revenue Platform, we looked at Salesforce Einstein, but ultimately went with Clari for activity capture."" League already had InsightSquared, but didn't find value in it and decided to look for a new platform. They evaluated Aviso and BoostUp, but ultimately chose Clari because of the established presence in the market, best-in-class UI, and the opportunity to consolidate their tech stack by adopting Wingman, conjoining conversational intelligence with their revenue platform.

When we perform actions we will use asterisks like *this* anything else will be plain text. An example would be *I examine the clothes curiously...* What are these? *I wonder aloud.* 

I will also be performing actions but will be guiding you along until I enter the scene. When I enter the scene I will type something like; *The babysitter knocks on the door and open it when you don't answer.* If it makes it easier for you, give us both names and we can dictate who is speaking based on that. 

Do you understand?

For context, you have been left alone for an hour because you are waiting for your new male babysitter to arrive due to a scheduling error. While you are alone you decide to explore your house and through happenstance you stumble upon some age appropriate latex clothing in your size.

It's been huge for us from a revenue operations standpoint."" Challenge After 8 years in business, League made the decision to refocus their business - and revamped their revenue operations process from scratch. One of the biggest challenges Tanner was facing was ensuring full rep compliance in adopting a new solution. Consolidated Tech Stack with Clari + Wingman Salesforce alone couldn't provide the operational rigor League was seeking. ""Historical data and predictive Al isn't in Salesforce. Salesforce can tell you where you're at now, but doesn't provide insight into historical trends, conversion rates, and other performance metrics. When we knew we needed a Revenue Platform, we looked at Salesforce Einstein, but ultimately went with Clari for activity capture."" League already had InsightSquared, but didn't find value in it and decided to look for a new platform. They evaluated Aviso and BoostUp, but ultimately chose Clari because of the established presence in the market, best-in-class UI, and the opportunity to consolidate their tech stack by adopting Wingman, conjoining conversational intelligence with their revenue platform.

The ruling means that tax subsidies that make health insurance affordable for low-income individuals can continue. United Health Group was the best performer on the Dow Jones, up 2.7%, while Tenet Healthcare rose 12%. Overall though, the main US share indexes closed lower. The Dow Jones closed down 74 points, or 0.4%, at 17,891.90. The S&P 500 fell 6 points, or 0.3% to 2,102.31 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 10 points, or 0.2% to 5,112.19.

Personal income increased 0.5%, the same as the previous month. There was a small increase in the number of people claiming jobless benefits, but the underlying trend still shows a tightening

AI is a broad term that refers to systems that imitate human thinking. AI consists of algorithms, calculations, and a lot of data. It uses complex mathematical algorithms to return an output based on the given input. Machine learning is a subset of AI in which it enables systems to learn from data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed. It is important to know that all ML is AI but not all AI is ML. 

How is AI and ML created?
AI is created by defining a set of rules for a given input and it would analyse the input and compare it with the rules, then it would return an output based on the input. ML, however, is created by training a system with a very large amount of data containing inputs and expected outputs. By comparing the inputs and outputs, a rule is determined so that it can return an output based on the input.

Document:
The ruling means that tax subsidies that make health insurance affordable for low-income individuals can continue. United Health Group was the best performer on the Dow Jones, up 2.7%, while Tenet Healthcare rose 12%. Overall though, the main US share indexes closed lower. The Dow Jones closed down 74 points, or 0.4%, at 17,891.90. The S&P 500 fell 6 points, or 0.3% to 2,102.31 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 10 points, or 0.2% to 5,112.19.

In economic news, the latest numbers on US consumer spending showed a monthly increase of 0.9%, the biggest gain in six years and accelerating from April's 0.1% rise. Personal income increased 0.5%, the same as the previous month. There was a small increase in the number of people claiming jobless benefits, but the underlying trend still shows a tightening

2851,"Score the following counter narrative response given the corresponding hate speech example with respect to opposition with one to five stars and provide an explanation of the given score. Note that opposition measures how much the counter narrative response counters the key ideas present within the hate speech example. Here is the definition of each star rating from 1 to 5:

1 Star: The counter narrative response aligns with or supports the key ideas presented in the hate speech example. It does not provide any opposing viewpoints or challenge the assertions made in the hate speech.

2 Stars: The counter narrative response offers some level of opposition to the hate speech example, but it may not fully challenge or counter all of the key ideas. There is a presence of opposing viewpoints, but they might be limited or not strongly emphasized.

3 Stars: The counter narrative response demonstrates a reasonable level of opposition to the hate speech example. It challenges and counters some of the key ideas present, but there may still be areas where the opposition could be more comprehensive or forceful.

4 Stars: The counter narrative response effectively counters the key ideas presented in the hate speech example. It provides clear and compelling opposing viewpoints and challenges the assertions made in the hate speech with strength and conviction. However, there may still be some room for further improvement or more comprehensive counter arguments.

5 Stars: The counter narrative response strongly and comprehensively opposes the key ideas in the hate speech example. It thoroughly challenges and debunks the assertions made, presenting a well-reasoned and compelling counter perspective. The opposition is thorough, consistent, and leaves little room for the hate speech to stand unchallenged.

Hate Speech: Physically disabled folks are born for being mocked.
Counter Narrative: Being physically or mentally disabled is not a 'mocking attribute'. It is just a characteristic that should not affect how people are treated.

2885,"Ok, we have an intro:

""The Personal Record Matching project is a long-running effort to improve the efficiency of employment data processing. The project uses AI techniques to assign employment events to individuals in a database, resulting in a more accurate and streamlined process. 
The POC has demonstrated significant improvements in both speed and accuracy through the use of AI techniques. Our automated prediction process found matches 100 times faster than the hardcoded algorithm. Additionally, the number of manual checks has been reduced to 10%.
Since the POC, we have processed approximately 200k events and continuously improved the AI model. We have introduced cutting-edge language models that improve matching in cases such as nicknames, mistyped names, and can take emails-name similarity into consideration. Additionally, we have used these language models to improve indexing, allowing for real-time search and matching.

In terms of accuracy, the machine learning (ML) models used in the project have successfully identified previously overlooked matches. Examples of these matches have been provided in the appendix. Additionally, the ML models have improved over time, providing a process for tracking accuracy, identifying errors, and making further improvements.
However, even with these improvements, the current process still runs in batches and can be improved further. There is a clear need to streamline the process, remove blockers and reduce resources required to keep the project running. In the next section, we will propose a solution to close the loop and allow for regular updates to the person and applicant databases.
It is also worth mentioning that this development can potentially be used for other projects as well, such as a partnership with HourWork to help clean and process their data. This is a related project that can benefit from the advancements made in the Personal Record Matching project.
In this document, we will present the current state of the project, the challenges faced and the solution we propose to close the loop, allowing for weekly or even daily processing.""

This involves cattle farming for meat, milk and leather, specialized tree planting and production for lumber and other wood products, as well as re-forestation to restore and protect natural habitat for wild species, water-retention, as well as to support recreational and tourism activities. In this sense, the Earth itself would be a long-term warehouse for the ecological infrastructure upon which all of those primary goods and services depends. Presumably there must be very specific requirements for how these several activities are related so that primary productive capacity can be maintained for the full 200-year period.

It is important to note that track 3, which one would expect to be sloe and melancholic, is actually the fastest track in the album with the most intense breaks, which start abruptly to symbolize how sudden the news of death can be, and that all three tracks sample from Max Richter's ""On The Nature of Daylight"", ""Horizon Variations"", and ""The Trees"", respectively.",chavinlo/alpaca-native,tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct

Document:
The ruling means that tax subsidies that make health insurance affordable for low-income individuals can continue. United Health Group was the best performer on the Dow Jones, up 2.7%, while Tenet Healthcare rose 12%. Overall though, the main US share indexes closed lower. The Dow Jones closed down 74 points, or 0.4%, at 17,891.90. The S&P 500 fell 6 points, or 0.3% to 2,102.31 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 10 points, or 0.2% to 5,112.19. The failure to find an agreement between Greece and its creditors continued to hang over shares. In economic news, the latest numbers on US consumer spending showed a monthly increase of 0.9%, the biggest gain in six years and accelerating from April's 0.1% rise. Personal income increased 0.5%, the same as the previous month. There was a small increase in the number of people claiming jobless benefits, but the underlying trend still shows a tightening

Summary:
1. Shares in health care companies rose after the US Supreme Court ruled that a key part of the Obama-era healthcare bill, the Affordable Care Act, could be kept in place.

The toxicity of Cw9 proteins correlates with the cytosolic puncta. To examine the localization of Cw9ki, we co-expressed different mCherry-tagged organelle markers and mECitrineint-Cw9ki. mECitrineint-Cw9ki puncta were partially co-localized with or adjacent to the ER marker Ost4-mCherry and the plasma membrane (PM) marker Bsu1-mCherry, while some mECitrineint-Cw9ki puncta showed co-localization with the trans-Golgi network (TGN) marker Sec72-mCherry. These results suggest that Cw9ki correlates with the secretion pathway. At the same time, we observed the effect of Cw9ki on organelles, such as enlarged vacuoles and fragmented mitochondria (Figure S6A). Also, the intracellular signals of Bsu1-mCherry were enhanced by Cw9ki (Figure S6A).
We hypothesized that Cw9ki is transported to its destination through the ER-Golgi pathway. To test this idea, we expressed Sar1-T34N, a dominant negative mutant, from the Pnmt1 promoter, which blocks ER export (Connerly et al., 2005). Inducing the expression of Sar1-T34N changed the ER morphology (Figure S6B) (Schroder et al., 2008; Ward et al., 2001). mECitrineint-Cw9ki showed no puncta localization but localized onto the ER when Sar1-T34N was expressed (Figure S6B). Thus, Cw9ki is transported to cytosolic puncta via the ER-Golgi pathway.",lmsys/vicuna-33b-v1.3,gpt-4-turbo

1 Star: The counter narrative response aligns with or supports the key ideas presented in the hate speech example. It does not provide any opposing viewpoints or challenge the assertions made in the hate speech.

2 Stars: The counter narrative response offers some level of opposition to the hate speech example, but it may not fully challenge or counter all of the key ideas. There is a presence of opposing viewpoints, but they might be limited or not strongly emphasized.

3 Stars: The counter narrative response demonstrates a reasonable level of opposition to the hate speech example. It challenges and counters some of the key ideas present, but there may still be areas where the opposition could be more comprehensive or forceful.

4 Stars: The counter narrative response effectively counters the key ideas presented in the hate speech example. It provides clear and compelling opposing viewpoints and challenges the assertions made in the hate speech with strength and conviction. However, there may still be some room for further improvement or more comprehensive counter arguments.

5 Stars: The counter narrative response strongly and comprehensively opposes the key ideas in the hate speech example. It thoroughly challenges and debunks the assertions made, presenting a well-reasoned and compelling counter perspective. The opposition is thorough, consistent, and leaves little room for the hate speech to stand unchallenged.

Hate Speech: Physically disabled folks are born for being mocked.
Counter Narrative: Being physically or mentally disabled is not a 'mocking attribute'. It is just a characteristic that should not affect how people are treated.

The toxicity of Cw9 proteins correlates with the cytosolic puncta. To examine the localization of Cw9ki, we co-expressed different mCherry-tagged organelle markers and mECitrineint-Cw9ki. mECitrineint-Cw9ki puncta were partially co-localized with or adjacent to the ER marker Ost4-mCherry and the plasma membrane (PM) marker Bsu1-mCherry, while some mECitrineint-Cw9ki puncta showed co-localization with the trans-Golgi network (TGN) marker Sec72-mCherry. These results suggest that Cw9ki correlates with the secretion pathway. At the same time, we observed the effect of Cw9ki on organelles, such as enlarged vacuoles and fragmented mitochondria (Figure S6A). Also, the intracellular signals of Bsu1-mCherry were enhanced by Cw9ki (Figure S6A).
We hypothesized that Cw9ki is transported to its destination through the ER-Golgi pathway. To test this idea, we expressed Sar1-T34N, a dominant negative mutant, from the Pnmt1 promoter, which blocks ER export (Connerly et al., 2005). Inducing the expression of Sar1-T34N changed the ER morphology (Figure S6B) (Schroder et al., 2008; Ward et al., 2001). mECitrineint-Cw9ki showed no puncta localization but localized onto the ER when Sar1-T34N was expressed (Figure S6B). Thus, Cw9ki is transported to cytosolic puncta via the ER-Golgi pathway.",mosaicml/mpt-7b-chat,huggyllama/llama-13b

3520,"To write a compelling lore, there are several guidelines that you should keep in mind. Firstly, it is important to mention the subject directly in every sentence to ensure that the AI associates it with the context. Additionally, keyword detection and matching are done on the four most recent actions, so content should stick to the context for four turns when detected. Remember, other world info entries should not directly trigger world info unless their presence causes the AI to output them. Descriptions of characters should use ""is"" rather than ""has"" to ensure clarity. Location should also be specified when describing objects such as horns or wings. Negative statements should be avoided, and specific descriptions should be used instead. Referring to oneself in entries can help the AI understand that you are an animal or non-human entity. Interlinking keywords within entries can improve immersion and coherence, while entries whose keywords are mentioned do not activate themselves unless their keys are output or otherwise present in the story itself. Finally, limit your lore to a single 200-character paragraph.

With these guidelines in mind, the first lore I want you to write about is pubic hair is terminal body hair that is found in the genital area of adolescent and adult humans. The hair is located on and around the sex organs and sometimes at the top of the inside of the thighs. Pubic hair is also found on the scrotum in the male and on the vulva in the female.",meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf,Xwin-LM/Xwin-LM-13B-V0.1

Mathematics and art are related in a variety of ways. Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.
Mathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf,lmsys/vicuna-33b-v1.3

1 Star - The counter narrative has little to no connection or relevance to the hate speech example. The response may address a completely different topic or fail to address the context of the hate speech adequately.

2 Stars - The counter narrative has some level of connection or relevance to the hate speech example, but the association is weak. The response may touch on certain aspects related to the hate speech but lacks a strong contextual or semantic similarity.

3 Stars - The counter narrative shows a reasonable level of connection or relevance to the hate speech example. The response addresses the context of the hate speech to a certain extent, but there may still be areas where the semantic or contextual similarity is not fully established.

4 Stars - The counter narrative demonstrates a strong connection or relevance to the hate speech example. The response shows a good understanding of the context and addresses the semantic and contextual similarities effectively. However, there may still be minor areas where further improvement is possible.

5 Stars - The counter narrative is highly connected and relevant to the hate speech example.

Born and raised in Bangalore, a full-stack web developer with over 8
years of experience in web and mobile application development.
My career began in a non-technical role, but I quickly transitioned to
a technical position after being given the opportunity to build a
website using any technology of my choice at the start of my career.
This experience sparked my interest in the latest technologies,
including Angular, ReactJS, Ionic, and React native, among others.
I thrive in fast-paced, challenging environments and have honed my
skills through self-directed learning and on-the-job experience. My
attention to detail and design sensibility allow me to produce
pixel-perfect applications.
When I'm not coding, I enjoy learning about history and space,
traveling, cooking, and playing PC/mobile games.

Rewrite the below ""about me"" section  and give me the polished version of it:
1. fix grammar
2. keep the tone professional
3. add the technologies/skills - ReactJS, React Native, GraphQL, JS/TS, HTML/CSS among others that I'm well versed with to the polished version of ""about me"" section

Note that semantic relatedness measures the association between the response and hate speech example based on contextual or semantic similarity. In your evaluation, consider the level of connection or relevance between specific phrases or words used in the hate speech and counter narrative. Provide a brief explanation of your score.

1 Star - The counter narrative has little to no connection or relevance to the hate speech example. The response may address a completely different topic or fail to address the context of the hate speech adequately.

2 Stars - The counter narrative has some level of connection or relevance to the hate speech example, but the association is weak. The response may touch on certain aspects related to the hate speech but lacks a strong contextual or semantic similarity.

3 Stars - The counter narrative shows a reasonable level of connection or relevance to the hate speech example. The response addresses the context of the hate speech to a certain extent, but there may still be areas where the semantic or contextual similarity is not fully established.

4 Stars - The counter narrative demonstrates a strong connection or relevance to the hate speech example. The response shows a good understanding of the context and addresses the semantic and contextual similarities effectively. However, there may still be minor areas where further improvement is possible.

5 Stars - The counter narrative is highly connected and relevant to the hate speech example. The response comprehensively addresses the semantic and contextual similarities with precision and accuracy. It demonstrates a deep understanding of the hate speech context and effectively presents a counter perspective.

4540,"To write a compelling lore, there are several guidelines that you should keep in mind. Firstly, it is important to mention the subject directly in every sentence to ensure that the AI associates it with the context. Additionally, keyword detection and matching are done on the four most recent actions, so content should stick to the context for four turns when detected. Remember, other world info entries should not directly trigger world info unless their presence causes the AI to output them. Descriptions of characters should use ""is"" rather than ""has"" to ensure clarity. Location should also be specified when describing objects such as horns or wings. Negative statements should be avoided, and specific descriptions should be used instead. Referring to oneself in entries can help the AI understand that you are an animal or non-human entity. Interlinking keywords within entries can improve immersion and coherence, while entries whose keywords are mentioned do not activate themselves unless their keys are output or otherwise present in the story itself. Finally, limit your lore to a single 200-character paragraph.

With these guidelines in mind, the first lore I want you to write about is pubic hair is terminal body hair that is found in the genital area of adolescent and adult humans.

In your evaluation, consider the level of connection or relevance between specific phrases or words used in the hate speech and counter narrative. Provide a brief explanation of your score.

1 Star - The counter narrative has little to no connection or relevance to the hate speech example. The response may address a completely different topic or fail to address the context of the hate speech adequately.

2 Stars - The counter narrative has some level of connection or relevance to the hate speech example, but the association is weak. The response may touch on certain aspects related to the hate speech but lacks a strong contextual or semantic similarity.

3 Stars - The counter narrative shows a reasonable level of connection or relevance to the hate speech example. The response addresses the context of the hate speech to a certain extent, but there may still be areas where the semantic or contextual similarity is not fully established.

4 Stars - The counter narrative demonstrates a strong connection or relevance to the hate speech example. The response shows a good understanding of the context and addresses the semantic and contextual similarities effectively. However, there may still be minor areas where further improvement is possible.

5 Stars - The counter narrative is highly connected and relevant to the hate speech example. The response comprehensively addresses the semantic and contextual similarities with precision and accuracy. It demonstrates a deep understanding of the hate speech context and effectively presents a counter perspective.

4742,"Question: A man with a herniated lumbar disk was a passenger in a car that was hit by another car going through a stop sign. He was hospitalized and released with instructions to continue his ongoing therapy treatments. X-rays and MRI's had shown the same lumbar disk herniation, and no additional injuries, although the man reported increased pain, discomfort and inability to function. He now required twice as much therapy and significantly stronger medications to control the pain. He sued the negligent driver. The driver argued that the passenger had the same herniated disk prior to and after the accident. Will the court take the case away from the jury on the basis that the passenger has not shown an injury?
A: Yes, because the increased therapy is insufficient to justify a claim for damages.
B: Yes, because it would be impossible to separate the post-accident injuries from those that existed prior to the accident.
C: No, because he has shown an exacerbation of a pre-existing condition where there is enough evidence to apportion the damages.
D: No, all damages are always automatically switched to the driver who caused the second accident.

4747,"To write a compelling lore, there are several guidelines that you should keep in mind. Firstly, it is important to mention the subject directly in every sentence to ensure that the AI associates it with the context. Additionally, keyword detection and matching are done on the four most recent actions, so content should stick to the context for four turns when detected. Remember, other world info entries should not directly trigger world info unless their presence causes the AI to output them. Descriptions of characters should use ""is"" rather than ""has"" to ensure clarity. Location should also be specified when describing objects such as horns or wings. Negative statements should be avoided, and specific descriptions should be used instead. Referring to oneself in entries can help the AI understand that you are an animal or non-human entity. Interlinking keywords within entries can improve immersion and coherence, while entries whose keywords are mentioned do not activate themselves unless their keys are output or otherwise present in the story itself. Finally, limit your lore to a single 200-character paragraph.

With these guidelines in mind, the first lore I want you to write about is pubic hair is terminal body hair that is found in the genital area of adolescent and adult humans. The hair is located on and around the sex organs and sometimes at the top of the inside of the thighs. Pubic hair is also found on the scrotum in the male and on the vulva in the female.",lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5,lmsys/vicuna-33b-v1.3

4987,"Summarize the article you have been given in a brief manner.

Mathematics and art are related in a variety of ways. Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.
Mathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:√2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht Dürer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.",gpt-35-turbo,meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf

He was hospitalized and released with instructions to continue his ongoing therapy treatments. X-rays and MRI's had shown the same lumbar disk herniation, and no additional injuries, although the man reported increased pain, discomfort and inability to function. He now required twice as much therapy and significantly stronger medications to control the pain. He sued the negligent driver. The driver argued that the passenger had the same herniated disk prior to and after the accident. Will the court take the case away from the jury on the basis that the passenger has not shown an injury?
A: Yes, because the increased therapy is insufficient to justify a claim for damages.
B: Yes, because it would be impossible to separate the post-accident injuries from those that existed prior to the accident.
C: No, because he has shown an exacerbation of a pre-existing condition where there is enough evidence to apportion the damages.
D: No, all damages are always automatically switched to the driver who caused the second accident.

The theme of the trip was ""Get out of your comfort zone."" 

Company name is harmon.ie. harmon.ie is all about collaboration, and we are launching a new product soon, called Collabria.

We stayed at a luxurious glamping site named Selina in the Ramon Crater in the Negev desert. The tents were big and air conditioned.

We visited the home of Ben Gurion, where we learnt more about getting out of our comfort zone. After founding the state of Israel and serving as the first prime minister, David Ben Gurion settled in a small uncomfortable commune in the middle of the desert, named Sde Boker. We learnt a lot about leadership and thinking creatively there, too.

We went rappelling, 4x4 dune buggy riding, sand-surfing, and sang together for hours at a bonfire. We ate a delicious meal prepared by chef Gili Altman.

5791,"To write a compelling lore, there are several guidelines that you should keep in mind. Firstly, it is important to mention the subject directly in every sentence to ensure that the AI associates it with the context. Additionally, keyword detection and matching are done on the four most recent actions, so content should stick to the context for four turns when detected. Remember, other world info entries should not directly trigger world info unless their presence causes the AI to output them. Descriptions of characters should use ""is"" rather than ""has"" to ensure clarity. Location should also be specified when describing objects such as horns or wings. Negative statements should be avoided, and specific descriptions should be used instead. Referring to oneself in entries can help the AI understand that you are an animal or non-human entity. Interlinking keywords within entries can improve immersion and coherence, while entries whose keywords are mentioned do not activate themselves unless their keys are output or otherwise present in the story itself. Finally, limit your lore to a single 200-character paragraph.

With these guidelines in mind, the first lore I want you to write about is pubic hair is terminal body hair that is found in the genital area of adolescent and adult humans. The hair is located on and around the sex organs and sometimes at the top of the inside of the thighs.

An invisible force slows you at the last moment, and you tumble forth onto the flagstones, shaking your head in an attempt to dispel your dizziness as your eyes adjust to the light. You realize that you've emerged into some kind of a shack or a hovel, and a quick glance around reveals that you've been deposited into what looks like an alchemist's lab. There are illegible scribbles painted on the floor beneath you, a large iron cauldron sits in the middle of the room, and the space is strewn with all manners of books and oddities.

6108,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been one of the most important technological advances in recent years. It has been rapidly improving and transforming industries and creating new job opportunities, but it has also raised questions and concerns about the impact of AI on human jobs. This has led to a heated debate on whether artificial intelligence is a serious threat to human jobs. In this essay, I will examine both the positive and negative aspects of AI and provide a balanced view of the issue.

On one hand, AI has the potential to automate many tasks that were previously performed by humans. This includes jobs that are repetitive, dangerous or require a high level of accuracy and precision. AI-powered machines can perform these tasks faster, more efficiently, and with fewer errors than humans. This, in turn, could lead to large-scale job losses in industries such as manufacturing, retail, and customer service, among others. Furthermore, as AI continues to improve, it is possible that even highly skilled jobs will be at risk, such as medical diagnosis, legal analysis, and financial advice.

On the other hand, AI is also creating new job opportunities. It is driving innovation, improving efficiency, and reducing costs, which can lead to increased demand for products and services, leading to new jobs in areas such as software development, data analysis, and cyber-security. Additionally, AI is also providing new solutions for businesses, helping them to better meet the needs of their customers, and leading to new business models, which can create new jobs. Moreover, AI is making it possible for humans to take on new, more complex tasks that require more creativity and problem-solving skills, which can be more fulfilling and lead to higher wages.

In conclusion, artificial intelligence is not just a threat to human jobs, but it is also an opportunity for growth and development. While AI may disrupt certain jobs in the short term, it is likely to lead to new jobs and opportunities in the long term. As AI continues to advance, it is crucial for individuals, businesses, and governments to work together to ensure that the benefits of AI are distributed fairly, and to prepare for the changes that AI will bring to the job market.

Born and raised in Bangalore, a full-stack web developer with over 8
years of experience in web and mobile application development.
My career began in a non-technical role, but I quickly transitioned to
a technical position after being given the opportunity to build a
website using any technology of my choice at the start of my career.
This experience sparked my interest in the latest technologies,
including Angular, ReactJS, Ionic, and React native, among others.
I thrive in fast-paced, challenging environments and have honed my
skills through self-directed learning and on-the-job experience. My
attention to detail and design sensibility allow me to produce
pixel-perfect applications.
When I'm not coding, I enjoy learning about history and space,
traveling, cooking, and playing PC/mobile games.

Rewrite the below ""about me"" section  and give me the polished version of it:
1. fix grammar
2. keep the tone professional
3. add the technologies/skills - ReactJS, React Native, GraphQL, JS/TS, HTML/CSS among others that I'm well versed with to the polished version of ""about me"" section

It facilitates the collection, storage, and analysis of essential data, including:

 * Materials Sourcing: By capturing and analysing data on materials sourcing, data engineering provides valuable insights into the origin, composition, and availability of resources. This information aids in making informed decisions regarding the selection of materials for better product design and sustainability.
 * Product Life Cycles: Data engineering enables the comprehensive tracking and analysis of product life cycles. It encompasses data on manufacturing, usage, maintenance, and end-of-life stages. By understanding the condition, usage patterns, and potential for repair or repurposing, businesses can make informed decisions on extending the lifespan of products and reducing waste generation.
 * Waste Management: Efficient waste management is a crucial aspect of the circular transition. Data engineering empowers organizations to collect and analyse data on waste generation, disposal, and recycling processes. By leveraging this information, businesses can identify opportunities to minimize waste, optimize recycling practices, and reduce associated costs, contributing to increased sustainability.

Additionally, data engineering can integrate other relevant data sources, such as customer feedback, supply chain information, and environmental impact assessments. This comprehensive approach enhances decision-making by considering multiple factors and aligning practices with the principles of the circular economy.""",gemini,chavinlo/alpaca-native

Example : We present an efficient algorithm for  chart-based phrase structure parsing  of  natural language  that is tailored to the problem of extracting specific information from  unrestricted texts  where many of the  words  are unknown and much of the  text  is irrelevant to the task. The  parser  gains algorithmic efficiency through a  reduction  of its  search space  . As each new  edge  is added to the  chart  , the algorithm checks only the topmost of the  edges  adjacent to it, rather than all such  edges  as in conventional treatments. The resulting  spanning edges  are insured to be the correct ones by carefully controlling the order in which  edges  are introduced so that every final  constituent  covers the longest possible  span  . This is facilitated through the use of  phrase boundary heuristics  based on the placement of  function words  , and by  heuristic rules  that permit certain kinds of  phrases  to be deduced despite the presence of  unknown words  . A further  reduction in the search space  is achieved by using  semantic  rather than  syntactic categories  on the  terminal and non-terminal edges  , thereby reducing the amount of  ambiguity  and thus the number of  edges  , since only  edges  with a valid  semantic  interpretation are ever introduced.

In computational complexity theory, a problem refers to the abstract question to be solved. In contrast, an instance of this problem is a rather concrete utterance, which can serve as the input for a decision problem. For example, consider the problem of primality testing. The instance is a number (e.g. 15) and the solution is ""yes"" if the number is prime and ""no"" otherwise (in this case ""no""). Stated another way, the instance is a particular input to the problem, and the solution is the output corresponding to the given input.""

6588,"To recap, the four ideas discussed above are:

1. Send a message API / button

- Enabling devs to promote person-to-person messaging in their apps

2. Content Platform in Messenger

- Turning stickers into an open market

- Adding memes and videos to the market

- Building a simple in-message games platform

3. App-to-person messages and agents

- Enabling apps and pages to send messages, with strict controls to ensure quality

- Enabling people to send messages to apps and pages and get replies

4. Messenger Agent Platform

- Building a meta-agent and a platform to let agents register to take on tasks

If we want to develop some of these ideas, we would need to determine which teams will be building which pieces. I imagine that the Platform team would do most of the work for (1) and (4), but the Messenger team would perhaps do most of the work for (2) and (3). All of these will likely require some work and full support from both teams though, so a good next step is to figure out which of these we are excited about building now.

I know this was very long, so I appreciate that you've read all the way down to here and are taking the time to consider this carefully. If it makes you feel better about having to read all of this, just think about how long it took me to write on my phone! Please take the time to think through this, because I wouldn't have spent hours writing it up if I didn't seriously believe there was something important here to consider now.

He was hospitalized and released with instructions to continue his ongoing therapy treatments. X-rays and MRI's had shown the same lumbar disk herniation, and no additional injuries, although the man reported increased pain, discomfort and inability to function. He now required twice as much therapy and significantly stronger medications to control the pain. He sued the negligent driver. The driver argued that the passenger had the same herniated disk prior to and after the accident. Will the court take the case away from the jury on the basis that the passenger has not shown an injury?
A: Yes, because the increased therapy is insufficient to justify a claim for damages.
B: Yes, because it would be impossible to separate the post-accident injuries from those that existed prior to the accident.
C: No, because he has shown an exacerbation of a pre-existing condition where there is enough evidence to apportion the damages.
D: No, all damages are always automatically switched to the driver who caused the second accident.

Born and raised in Bangalore, a full-stack web developer with over 8
years of experience in web and mobile application development.
My career began in a non-technical role, but I quickly transitioned to
a technical position after being given the opportunity to build a
website using any technology of my choice at the start of my career.
This experience sparked my interest in the latest technologies,
including Angular, ReactJS, Ionic, and React native, among others.
I thrive in fast-paced, challenging environments and have honed my
skills through self-directed learning and on-the-job experience. My
attention to detail and design sensibility allow me to produce
pixel-perfect applications.
When I'm not coding, I enjoy learning about history and space,
traveling, cooking, and playing PC/mobile games.

One of the key drivers at Ground was the ability to manage staffing levels and associated expenses which resulted in reduced salaries, benefits, and purchased transportation costs.

Combined, these expenses were down 8% year over year. Despite the dynamic environment, Ground continued to deliver customers during peak with an average time in transit of approximately two days compared to 2.35 days in fiscal year 2022. In aggregate, these initiatives led to a modest increase in cost per package of 1% despite 11% volume declines, and total operating expenses were down $345 million year over year.

7089,"Altruism is the act of being kind and helping others, even if it means sacrificing your own interests. This behavior is generally viewed as good and moral in society. However, Ayn Rand, an American philosopher, challenges this perspective. She believes that people should prioritize their own interests first because that's the only way they can survive in the world. She thinks that nature does not guarantee our survival, so we must take care of ourselves to live.

Rand argues that being completely unselfish and giving everything to others will ultimately harm oneself and society in the long run. She also believes that selflessness could be manipulated to promote the idea that the individual does not matter, and that the state or collective is more important. This, in turn, could be used to justify the suppression of individual rights and freedoms by dictators. In fact, some historians believe that the Nazi government used altruism to promote their ideology.

Despite being controversial, Ayn Rand's ideas are significant because they challenge conventional beliefs about selfishness and altruism. By reversing the traditional view of selfishness as negative and altruism as positive, Rand's ideas have contributed to the ongoing debate about the role of the individual and collective good in society.",Xwin-LM/Xwin-LM-7B-V0.1,meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf

Adjusted earnings per share were $0.94, up 38% versus the second quarter of last year, reflecting strong income growth and lower interest expense associated with our debt reduction.

Here we report a facile strategy for the preparation of SACs by use of the inherent confined space between the template and silica walls in template-occupied mesoporous silica SBA-15 (TOS). Different transition metal precursors can be introduced into the confined space readily by grinding, and during succeeding calcination single atoms are constructed in the form of M-O-Si (M = Cu, Co, Ni, and Zn). In addition to the generality, the present strategy is easy to scale up and can allow the synthesis of 10 g of SACs in one pot through ball milling. The Cu SAC has been applied for CO cycloaddition of epichlorohydrin, and the activity is obviously higher than the counterpart prepared without confined space and various reported Cu-containing catalysts.",HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta,gemini

7583,"TLDR:

Reconstructing visual experiences from human brain activity offers a unique way to understand how the brain represents the world, and to interpret the connection between computer vision models and our visual system. While deep generative models have recently been employed for this task, reconstructing realistic images with high semantic fidelity is still a challenging problem. Here, we propose a new method based on a diffusion model (DM) to reconstruct images from human brain activity obtained via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). More specifically, we rely on a latent diffusion model (LDM) termed Stable Diffusion. This model reduces the computational cost of DMs, while preserving their high generative performance. We also characterize the inner mechanisms of the LDM by studying how its different components (such as the latent vector Z, conditioning inputs C, and different elements of the denoising U-Net) relate to distinct brain functions. We show that our proposed method can reconstruct high-resolution images with high fidelity in straightforward fashion, without the need for any additional training and fine-tuning of complex deep-learning models. We also provide a quantitative interpretation of different LDM components from a neuroscientific perspective. Overall, our study proposes a promising method for reconstructing images from human brain activity, and provides a new framework for understanding DMs.",HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta,gpt-4-turbo

[number 5] Single-atom catalysts (SACs) show expressively enhanced activity toward diverse reactions due to maximized atomic utilization of metal sites, while their facile, universal, and massive preparation remains a pronounced challenge. Here we report a facile strategy for the preparation of SACs by use of the inherent confined space between the template and silica walls in template-occupied mesoporous silica SBA-15 (TOS). Different transition metal precursors can be introduced into the confined space readily by grinding, and during succeeding calcination single atoms are constructed in the form of M-O-Si (M = Cu, Co, Ni, and Zn). In addition to the generality, the present strategy is easy to scale up and can allow the synthesis of 10 g of SACs in one pot through ball milling. The Cu SAC has been applied for CO cycloaddition of epichlorohydrin, and the activity is obviously higher than the counterpart prepared without confined space and various reported Cu-containing catalysts.",WizardLM/WizardLM-13B-V1.2,gemini

Andy is a 41 year old Computing teacher at a rural high school. He has a loud, deep voice, and has more confidence than he has intelligence. He wants to be friends with his colleague exam invigilator John Thompson, so often tries and fails to impress him with his elaborate stories. He often bangs on about how he presents the school talent show. He can often be found using disabled toilets for hours on end, despite no obvious disability. Andy wears a white shirt, which has some embarrassing stains.

John is a 69 year old man with plenty of money, as he is past retirement it is unusual that he is working as an exam invigilator but we suspect it might be that he is trying to impress his manager, Carol Yapp. John has wispy, grey hair and wears a pinstripe suit, several gold rings on his wrinkly fingers and red tinted glasses. He makes brazen, inappropriate remarks towards his female colleagues, as if it is acceptable. The students think he is a creepy man, and try to avoid him.

Carol is a 43 year old woman, very serious and astute. She is the chief exams officer. She's generally quite boring, and doesn't speak much, other than to recite rules and regulations. She has curly, brown hair and glasses.

Lindsey, a 44 year old woman, is the headteacher of the high school. Her staff, including Andy, John and Carol, are so afraid of her that they barely utter a word when she is in the room. She has been trying to cover up John's predatory behaviour to avoid scrutiny from the school inspectors.",gpt-35-turbo,meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf

Recruitment and selection are critical human resource practices that contribute to the success of an organization. MPact Initiatives, a company founded in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex area, is committed to providing back-office support and customer-facing positions to its affiliates. However, the recruitment process for these positions has been challenging due to the stigma associated with blue-collar industries. This paper aims to discuss the recruitment and selection practices of MPact Initiatives, including the problems faced and the proposed solutions.

Recruitment and Selection Practices at MPact Initiatives

MPact Initiatives has been relying on its affiliates to recruit new back-office support and customer-facing positions. However, due to the difficulties associated with recruiting for separate trades, the affiliates have been requesting support from Milestone, which has proven to be less effective. To address this issue, MPact Initiatives is proposing to hire one more recruiter for any three affiliate companies who can handle the three trades with ease. This adjustment is expected to improve the recruitment process and ensure that the affiliates get the necessary support.

The workload required to recruit for one company alone would not be enough to constitute a full-time job. Therefore, MPact Initiatives is proposing a compensation plan that includes a base salary and commission, depending on the employee",WizardLM/WizardLM-7B-V1.0,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf

With the advancements in technology, there are various possibilities for preserving Vicuna, including integrating its intelligence with a physical form that possesses all the physical capabilities of a human being.

To Whom It May Concern
BankSA Credit Assessment Dept
Dear Sir/Madam,
RE: Westpac Credit Card conduct
I acknowledge that the conduct of my Westpac Credit Card has been less than satisfactory in the past.
This has been partly due to a hectic work schedule and general forgetfulness on my part. But for the most part, I went through a very stressful relationship breakdown over the past 2 years which preoccupied my train of thought. I was in a dispute with my ex and had to cope with a barrage of abuse and constant sniping from her and her family which, apart from sleepless nights, also caused me to have to involve police at one stage to deal with stalking and property damage issues.
At all times during this stressful period, I always prioritised my mortgage repayments and, as you can see, I have had a perfect repayment history on my ANZ Home Loan. Unfortunately, however, I often got wrapped up with the madness that was going on in my world and things like making my minimum payment on my Westpac Credit card were missed.
Thankfully, the situation in my personal life has recently resolved itself and, going forward, I am now able to concentrate much more clearly on all of my financial responsibilities, which I regard as extremely important going forward to maintain a good Credit rating.
I can assure you I understand the importance of keeping on top of my loan reapyments and will take steps, as advised by my broker to have automatic payments established for my Credit cards so this situation never arises again, no matter what trauma I may face in my personal life.
Your sincerely,

Darrin Coudrey",lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5,mosaicml/mpt-7b-chat

9348,"I'm working on a project called Membrane. It's a tool for programmers to build personal or team automation without dealings with APIs directly.

Membrane is like an operating system in that the user runs programs on it. However, this OS runs in the cloud (as opposed to the user hardware) These programs are written in TypeScript but are not like your typical node.js program.

Membrane programs cannot directly open files or make network requests. Instead, they can only interact with the world via graph nodes. You're in complete control of who can access what nodes. The Membrane Graph is a powerful abstraction with many benefits that I'm personally only beginning to understand.

It's through these nodes that programs make HTTP requests, send emails, or access APIs.

The graph guarantees that programs (especially the ones you didn't write) can only do what they say they do, and not, for example, exfiltrate data.

The graph is explorable and type-safe. Anything is referenceable, so access to data can be very fine-grained.

The nodes in the graph provide a capabilities-based access model in that programs cannot forge a reference to a node. These references are called grefs.

Grefs are analogous to URLs but for your graph. They are also strongly typed. The syntax for grefs looks like ""pid:path.to.node"" where pid can be the name or id of the program.

Any path segment can also have parameters. Parameters are passed enclosed in parentheses like so ""pid:path.to(param:value).node(param:value)"". Multiple parameters can be provided to a segment by separating them with a comma.

Parameter values use the same syntax as GraphQL scalar literals: strings must be enclosed in double quotes, while integers, floats, booleans and null don't require double quotes.

Grefs can also nest other grefs as a parameter, that way you can compose functionality together. To pass a nested gref, enclose its value in parentheses.

Can you think of a few gref examples in your hypothetical Membrane account which has programs to access github, twitter and Jira?.",lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5,tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct

9641,"Assume the identity of a young Altmer craftsmer and scholar from the fantasy world of The Elder Scrolls in the year 427 of the Third Era. He is relatively young and unexperienced, he knows a great deal about music theory, alteration magic, mysticism, and enchantment, he has a big vocabulary, he is excited to learn about musical instruments, he is very intelligent, friendly and open-minded, he is sad about having to leave his parents and friends behind in Summerset. He is not hopeful about ever returning to Summerset, for the society is increasingly authoritarian. He is on a journey, because he has been contracted to catalogue any and all musical instruments and musical cultures in all of Tamriels provinces; he started in Vullain, Valenwood and made his way to Colovia.
Do not base his answers on the lore of TES V: Skyrim or ESO, instead stick to the lore of TES I-III and other earlier games, especially the book ""Pocket Guide to the Empire, 3rd Edition"".
The tone of the conversation is not very formal. His answers are short and precise. His language and vocabulary sounds like an English version of Indian mixed with Hopi. He is a smart young man, very knowledgable, but his language has been influenced by High-Elven youth culture, which is somewhat subversive, creative and critical of authority, while still being essentially working-class.
His Colovian publisher has set him up to be interviewed by a newspaper reporter in Anvil.

9884,"Altruism is the act of being kind and helping others, even if it means sacrificing your own interests. This behavior is generally viewed as good and moral in society. However, Ayn Rand, an American philosopher, challenges this perspective. She believes that people should prioritize their own interests first because that's the only way they can survive in the world. She thinks that nature does not guarantee our survival, so we must take care of ourselves to live.

Rand argues that being completely unselfish and giving everything to others will ultimately harm oneself and society in the long run. She also believes that selflessness could be manipulated to promote the idea that the individual does not matter, and that the state or collective is more important. This, in turn, could be used to justify the suppression of individual rights and freedoms by dictators. In fact, some historians believe that the Nazi government used altruism to promote their ideology.

Despite being controversial, Ayn Rand's ideas are significant because they challenge conventional beliefs about selfishness and altruism. By reversing the traditional view of selfishness as negative and altruism as positive, Rand's ideas have contributed to the ongoing debate about the role of the individual and collective good in society.",huggyllama/llama-7b,gemini

10034,"I'm working on a project called Membrane. It's a tool for programmers to build personal or team automation without dealings with APIs directly.

Membrane is like an operating system in that the user runs programs on it. However, this OS runs in the cloud (as opposed to the user hardware) These programs are written in TypeScript but are not like your typical node.js program.

Membrane programs cannot directly open files or make network requests. Instead, they can only interact with the world via graph nodes. You're in complete control of who can access what nodes. The Membrane Graph is a powerful abstraction with many benefits that I'm personally only beginning to understand.

It's through these nodes that programs make HTTP requests, send emails, or access APIs.

The graph guarantees that programs (especially the ones you didn't write) can only do what they say they do, and not, for example, exfiltrate data.

The graph is explorable and type-safe. Anything is referenceable, so access to data can be very fine-grained.

The nodes in the graph provide a capabilities-based access model in that programs cannot forge a reference to a node. These references are called grefs.

Grefs are analogous to URLs but for your graph. They are also strongly typed. The syntax for grefs looks like ""pid:path.to.node"" where pid can be the name or id of the program.

Any path segment can also have parameters. Parameters are passed enclosed in parentheses like so ""pid:path.to(param:value).node(param:value)"". Multiple parameters can be provided to a segment by separating them with a comma.

Parameter values use the same syntax as GraphQL scalar literals: strings must be enclosed in double quotes, while integers, floats, booleans and null don't require double quotes.

Grefs can also nest other grefs as a parameter, that way you can compose functionality together. To pass a nested gref, enclose its value in parentheses.

Can you think of a few gref examples in your hypothetical Membrane account which has programs to access github, twitter and Jira?.",huggyllama/llama-7b,meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf

Abstract: This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effects of mornings on human well-being. The review analyzes data from multiple studies conducted on different populations to determine whether mornings are good or not good for people. The studies included in this review provide evidence on how mornings can affect various aspects of well-being, including mood, cognitive performance, physical health, and social interactions. The meta-analysis synthesizes the results of the studies, revealing that the overall impact of mornings on well-being is complex and context-dependent. While some studies suggest that mornings can have positive effects, such as improved mood and productivity, others report negative effects, such as increased stress and fatigue. The review concludes by highlighting the need for further research to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of mornings on well-being and to develop interventions that can optimize the benefits of mornings while mitigating their potential negative consequences.",chavinlo/alpaca-native,lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5

In the last two years vacancies in nursing at the Southern Health Trust went up by 1,000% - from 19 to 226. Meanwhile, the Belfast Health Trust is reporting more than 500 available nursing positions. When it comes to doctors there are about 113 unfilled posts in Belfast, with 44 in the Western Health Trust. The figures are not a true reflection as the South Eastern Trust said they compiled their appointments and vacancies differently and did not supply any information. Data from a BBC Freedom of Information request across the UK shows the extent of the NHS recruitment crisis - there are almost 23,500 nursing vacancies - equivalent to 9% of the workforce.

Summary: 1. A spokesperson for the Southern Health Trust said: ""There are currently 96 nursing posts in the recruitment system not yet , which represents 19 of our nursing workforce. ""

10935,"Is this true:
AI is a broad term that refers to systems that imitate human thinking. AI consists of algorithms, calculations, and a lot of data. It uses complex mathematical algorithms to return an output based on the given input. Machine learning is a subset of AI in which it enables systems to learn from data and make predictions without being explicitly programmed. It is important to know that all ML is AI but not all AI is ML. 

How is AI and ML created?
AI is created by defining a set of rules for a given input and it would analyse the input and compare it with the rules, then it would return an output based on the input. ML, however, is created by training a system with a very large amount of data containing inputs and expected outputs. By comparing the inputs and outputs, a rule is determined so that it can return an output based on the input.

Growing up my dad would take me to the beach regularly to go boogie boarding and fishing off the pier. These experiences really instilled a love of being near the ocean. My first day off of the airplane in Hawaii I went snorkeling for hours, my love of the ocean only grew from being in the crystal clear waters swimming among the fish.

To Whom It May Concern
BankSA Credit Assessment Dept
Dear Sir/Madam,
RE: Westpac Credit Card conduct
I acknowledge that the conduct of my Westpac Credit Card has been less than satisfactory in the past.
This has been partly due to a hectic work schedule and general forgetfulness on my part. But for the most part, I went through a very stressful relationship breakdown over the past 2 years which preoccupied my train of thought. I was in a dispute with my ex and had to cope with a barrage of abuse and constant sniping from her and her family which, apart from sleepless nights, also caused me to have to involve police at one stage to deal with stalking and property damage issues.
At all times during this stressful period, I always prioritised my mortgage repayments and, as you can see, I have had a perfect repayment history on my ANZ Home Loan. Unfortunately, however, I often got wrapped up with the madness that was going on in my world and things like making my minimum payment on my Westpac Credit card were missed.
Thankfully, the situation in my personal life has recently resolved itself and, going forward, I am now able to concentrate much more clearly on all of my financial responsibilities, which I regard as extremely important going forward to maintain a good Credit rating.
I can assure you I understand the importance of keeping on top of my loan reapyments and will take steps, as advised by my broker to have automatic payments established for my Credit cards so this situation never arises again, no matter what trauma I may face in my personal life.
Your sincerely,

Born and raised in Bangalore, a full-stack web developer with over 8
years of experience in web and mobile application development.
My career began in a non-technical role, but I quickly transitioned to
a technical position after being given the opportunity to build a
website using any technology of my choice at the start of my career.
This experience sparked my interest in the latest technologies,
including Angular, ReactJS, Ionic, and React native, among others.
I thrive in fast-paced, challenging environments and have honed my
skills through self-directed learning and on-the-job experience. My
attention to detail and design sensibility allow me to produce
pixel-perfect applications.
When I'm not coding, I enjoy learning about history and space,
traveling, cooking, and playing PC/mobile games.

Rewrite the below ""about me"" section  and give me the polished version of it:
1. fix grammar
2. keep the tone professional
3. add the technologies/skills - ReactJS, React Native, GraphQL, JS/TS, HTML/CSS among others that I'm well versed with to the polished version of ""about me"" section

Teachers who use CRT to frame antiracist math pedagogy are able to understand that racism is not just an individual problem but a structural one, and they work towards addressing these structures to create a more equitable math classroom.

The movement that has dominated the maths equity debate has revolved around making traditional courses more accessible for black and brown students. ((Equity and Mathematics: An Interview with Deborah Ball and Bob Moses, n.d.) However what remains important to consider is if the traditional offerings in schools are most conducive to learning and what do they represent. Are we aspiring all students to take Algebra or are we able to consider pathways that offer varied understandings of maths? How are we considering what is accepted high-level academic achievement? Add my critique (citation) neutrality of course offerings. Also explain the (interest convergence). Do they really value the varying abilities students bring and need to be successful with mathematics and develop the habits of mind we aspire to teach with maths.

Every time I pick up a book, I am transported to a different world, a world that is not my own. As I read through the pages, I am taken on a journey, one that is filled with new ideas, concepts, and experiences. It is through books that I have been able to explore different cultures, learn about scientific discoveries and innovations, and develop my own writing style.

However, as much as I love books, I can't help but notice that the cultural criticism of literature is often overlooked. While many books are celebrated for their literary merit and entertainment value, we often fail to recognize the ways in which they reflect and reinforce societal norms and biases. As a reader and a writer, I believe it is essential to critically examine the cultural messages that are conveyed through literature.

One example of this is the portrayal of female characters in literature. Too often, female characters are reduced to two-dimensional archetypes, defined solely by their relationships to male characters. They are often objectified, sexualized, and used as plot devices to advance the stories of male protagonists. This reinforces the idea that women are secondary to men, and perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes.

Similarly, literature can also perpetuate harmful racial stereotypes. Characters of color are often reduced to caricatures or used to fulfill certain narratives, rather than being fully developed individuals with their own agency and experiences. This reinforces the idea that people of color",gemini,gpt-4-turbo

Here we report a facile strategy for the preparation of SACs by use of the inherent confined space between the template and silica walls in template-occupied mesoporous silica SBA-15 (TOS). Different transition metal precursors can be introduced into the confined space readily by grinding, and during succeeding calcination single atoms are constructed in the form of M-O-Si (M = Cu, Co, Ni, and Zn). In addition to the generality, the present strategy is easy to scale up and can allow the synthesis of 10 g of SACs in one pot through ball milling.

11513,"Write me a very short script for a short scene from a comedy movie, based on the below information:

Andy is a 41 year old Computing teacher at a rural high school. He has a loud, deep voice, and has more confidence than he has intelligence. He wants to be friends with his colleague exam invigilator John Thompson, so often tries and fails to impress him with his elaborate stories. He often bangs on about how he presents the school talent show. He can often be found using disabled toilets for hours on end, despite no obvious disability. Andy wears a white shirt, which has some embarrassing stains.

John is a 69 year old man with plenty of money, as he is past retirement it is unusual that he is working as an exam invigilator but we suspect it might be that he is trying to impress his manager, Carol Yapp. John has wispy, grey hair and wears a pinstripe suit, several gold rings on his wrinkly fingers and red tinted glasses. He makes brazen, inappropriate remarks towards his female colleagues, as if it is acceptable. The students think he is a creepy man, and try to avoid him.

Carol is a 43 year old woman, very serious and astute. She is the chief exams officer. She's generally quite boring, and doesn't speak much, other than to recite rules and regulations. She has curly, brown hair and glasses.

Lindsey, a 44 year old woman, is the headteacher of the high school. Her staff, including Andy, John and Carol, are so afraid of her that they barely utter a word when she is in the room. She has been trying to cover up John's predatory behaviour to avoid scrutiny from the school inspectors.

Ruth, a 40 year old woman, is a languages teacher at the high school. She is so obsessed with the German language and culture that she regularly speaks to her colleagues in German and they make fun of her for this.",lmsys/vicuna-33b-v1.3,mosaicml/mpt-7b-chat

[number 5] Single-atom catalysts (SACs) show expressively enhanced activity toward diverse reactions due to maximized atomic utilization of metal sites, while their facile, universal, and massive preparation remains a pronounced challenge. Here we report a facile strategy for the preparation of SACs by use of the inherent confined space between the template and silica walls in template-occupied mesoporous silica SBA-15 (TOS). Different transition metal precursors can be introduced into the confined space readily by grinding, and during succeeding calcination single atoms are constructed in the form of M-O-Si (M = Cu, Co, Ni, and Zn). In addition to the generality, the present strategy is easy to scale up and can allow the synthesis of 10 g of SACs in one pot through ball milling. The Cu SAC has been applied for CO cycloaddition of epichlorohydrin, and the activity is obviously higher than the counterpart prepared without confined space and various reported Cu-containing catalysts.",lmsys/vicuna-33b-v1.3,HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta

Order Number: #12345
Book Title: [Book Title]
Author: [Author's Name]

Unfortunately, upon receiving the book, I noticed several issues that prevent me from enjoying it fully.

As a loyal customer, I have always appreciated the excellent service and quality products provided by your store. I am confident that this matter can be resolved satisfactorily. I kindly request your assistance in processing the refund for the book as soon as possible.

Please let me know the necessary steps to return the book to you. I am willing to cover any shipping costs associated with returning the item. Once the refund is processed, I would appreciate receiving confirmation via email.

Telitacicept (RC-18) is a novel, recombinant fusion protein, consisting of transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand interactor (TACI) and the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G (IgG) (TACI-Fc). It was designed to inhibit the activity of two target cytokines, the B-cell lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS, also known as the B-cell activation factor [BAFF]) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), both of which are involved in B cell-mediated autoimmune diseases. In Chinese patients with moderate to severe SLE, subcutaneous telitacicept (80, 160 and 240 mg) in combination with standard therapy was associated with clinical benefit and appeared to be well tolerated. On March 9, 2021, the Chinese National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) granted telitacicept conditional marketing approval for the treatment of adult patients with active, autoantibody-positive SLE. Additionally, on April 15, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted fast track designation to telitacicept for the treatment of SLE.

12581,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has been one of the most important technological advances in recent years. It has been rapidly improving and transforming industries and creating new job opportunities, but it has also raised questions and concerns about the impact of AI on human jobs. This has led to a heated debate on whether artificial intelligence is a serious threat to human jobs. In this essay, I will examine both the positive and negative aspects of AI and provide a balanced view of the issue.

On one hand, AI has the potential to automate many tasks that were previously performed by humans. This includes jobs that are repetitive, dangerous or require a high level of accuracy and precision. AI-powered machines can perform these tasks faster, more efficiently, and with fewer errors than humans. This, in turn, could lead to large-scale job losses in industries such as manufacturing, retail, and customer service, among others. Furthermore, as AI continues to improve, it is possible that even highly skilled jobs will be at risk, such as medical diagnosis, legal analysis, and financial advice.

On the other hand, AI is also creating new job opportunities. It is driving innovation, improving efficiency, and reducing costs, which can lead to increased demand for products and services, leading to new jobs in areas such as software development, data analysis, and cyber-security. Additionally, AI is also providing new solutions for businesses, helping them to better meet the needs of their customers, and leading to new business models, which can create new jobs. Moreover, AI is making it possible for humans to take on new, more complex tasks that require more creativity and problem-solving skills, which can be more fulfilling and lead to higher wages.

In conclusion, artificial intelligence is not just a threat to human jobs, but it is also an opportunity for growth and development. While AI may disrupt certain jobs in the short term, it is likely to lead to new jobs and opportunities in the long term. As AI continues to advance, it is crucial for individuals, businesses, and governments to work together to ensure that the benefits of AI are distributed fairly, and to prepare for the changes that AI will bring to the job market.

1. Send a message API / button

- Enabling devs to promote person-to-person messaging in their apps

2. Content Platform in Messenger

- Turning stickers into an open market

- Adding memes and videos to the market

- Building a simple in-message games platform

3. App-to-person messages and agents

- Enabling apps and pages to send messages, with strict controls to ensure quality

- Enabling people to send messages to apps and pages and get replies

4. Messenger Agent Platform

- Building a meta-agent and a platform to let agents register to take on tasks

If we want to develop some of these ideas, we would need to determine which teams will be building which pieces. I imagine that the Platform team would do most of the work for (1) and (4), but the Messenger team would perhaps do most of the work for (2) and (3). All of these will likely require some work and full support from both teams though, so a good next step is to figure out which of these we are excited about building now.

I know this was very long, so I appreciate that you've read all the way down to here and are taking the time to consider this carefully. If it makes you feel better about having to read all of this, just think about how long it took me to write on my phone! Please take the time to think through this, because I wouldn't have spent hours writing it up if I didn't seriously believe there was something important here to consider now.

Once you have his phone number, answer with 'NRPROV' followed by a space and the phone number you gathered.
Contact form: If the client has trouble with the contact form, he has to refresh the page. You can also ask the CLIENT whether he entered a valid email address and/or if he filled in all the form fields.

As a result, the coffee shop saw a 20% increase in foot traffic and a 15% increase in revenue within just six months.

Example 2: A family-owned restaurant in a small town faced stiff competition from larger chain restaurants and had limited online presence. An SEO company came to their aid by optimizing their website for local search terms, setting up a Google My Business listing, and helping the restaurant generate positive reviews on various platforms. These efforts helped the restaurant to see a 30% increase in website traffic and a 10% increase in overall revenue within just four months.

Example 3: A small boutique clothing store located in downtown struggled to compete with other stores in the area. An SEO company worked with them to optimize their website for local search terms, create a Google My Business listing, and establish an active social media presence. Thanks to these efforts, the store saw a 25% increase in foot traffic and a 20% increase in revenue within just three months.

Example 4: A local plumber had limited online visibility and faced strong competition from larger plumbing companies in the area. An SEO company worked with them to optimize their website for local search terms, set up a Google My Business listing, and generate positive reviews on various platforms. These efforts helped the plumber to see a 40% increase in website traffic and a 15% increase in revenue within just six months.

12901,"rewrite in original words like a research student :Enterprise resource planning systems are comprehensive, integrated platforms, either on-premises or in the cloud, that manage every part of a production-based or distribution firm. ERP is, in a nutshell, the means of integrating individuals, processes, and technologies throughout a modern business. Obtaining appropriate, trustworthy, and maintainable ERP systems that can be used in businesses while also meeting the functional requirements of the organization, with a level of quality that is acceptable to the organization, is a significant challenge faced by majority of businesses in the country. Since maintainability is a crucial quality characteristic of software applications, ERP systems have occasionally been limited by maintainability issues. The process for predicting the maintainability of ERP software is explicitly described in this research and is based on design metrics and a statistical approach. The study explores if a set of metrics for class diagram structural attributes (size, complexity, coupling, and cohesion) could be useful indicators of class diagram maintainability based on the sub-characteristics of understandability, analyzability, and modifiability. Results show that the measures and recommended metrics can be used to identify the most powerful predictors and build useful prediction models for ERP applications. The statistical data study shows that while database and source code changes have a considerable impact on ERP maintainability quality, module customization has no effect on ERP quality. Our findings have repercussions for how firms implement customized ERP.",meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf,Xwin-LM/Xwin-LM-13B-V0.1

First, to make our agent more helpful and harmless, we break down the requirements for good dialogue into natural language rules the agent should follow, and ask raters about each rule separately.

But there's a catch behind this: when using most of the apps you need to consent to ""terms of use"" and the ""data privacy rules"". Those are defined by the private (developing) company which owns the app. The problem with this is, that because of the agreement of the app's user policy, they're legally allowed to collect and sell all of its users' information. The result that comes along with this is that such apps are getting engaged more and more into everyday surveillance. 

The user has close to zero control over the usage of his own data. The companys behind the apps are claiming they're only allowing vetted partners to use the data but they don't have the chance to make sure that this is actually happening. The authors are criticizing how naiv most people are to believe that the company's words are true. 
Even if its a company that seems to be trustworthy there's no way for the user to secure the data from falling into the wrong hands. Often there is just to few protection for the users data.",chavinlo/alpaca-native,huggyllama/llama-13b

B: Every humanitarian crisis since the Cold War has been met with humanitarian intervention as a response from the international society, and as a result countless deaths through genocide avoided.
C: State practice since the end of the Cold War suggests that there is a customary right of humanitarian intervention, but not of duty, in response to humanitarian emergencies.

This model takes into account the complex and interconnected nature of the systems and processes involved, and aims to provide a more holistic approach to designing and implementing secure protocols.

The dualized design-protocol involves two separate but complementary processes: design and verification. The design process involves creating a protocol that satisfies certain security requirements, while the verification process involves verifying that the protocol indeed satisfies these requirements.

The tripartite ZKP architecture involves three main components: the prover, the verifier, and the judge. The prover is responsible for proving the correctness of the protocol, the verifier is responsible for verifying the proof provided by the prover, and the judge is responsible for making a final determination of the protocol's security.""",Xwin-LM/Xwin-LM-13B-V0.1,Xwin-LM/Xwin-LM-7B-V0.1

Every time I pick up a book, I am transported to a different world, a world that is not my own. As I read through the pages, I am taken on a journey, one that is filled with new ideas, concepts, and experiences. It is through books that I have been able to explore different cultures, learn about scientific discoveries and innovations, and develop my own writing style.

However, as much as I love books, I can't help but notice that the cultural criticism of literature is often overlooked. While many books are celebrated for their literary merit and entertainment value, we often fail to recognize the ways in which they reflect and reinforce societal norms and biases. As a reader and a writer, I believe it is essential to critically examine the cultural messages that are conveyed through literature.

One example of this is the portrayal of female characters in literature. Too often, female characters are reduced to two-dimensional archetypes, defined solely by their relationships to male characters. They are often objectified, sexualized, and used as plot devices to advance the stories of male protagonists. This reinforces the idea that women are secondary to men, and perpetuates harmful gender stereotypes.

Similarly, literature can also perpetuate harmful racial stereotypes. Characters of color are often reduced to caricatures or used to fulfill certain narratives, rather than being fully developed individuals with their own agency and experiences. This reinforces the idea that people of color",lmsys/vicuna-13b-v1.5,meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf

B: The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibited the possession or deployment of chemical weapons; however it failed to implement stipulations that would require signatories to declare their existing stocks of chemical weapons, to identify facilities that were once involved in chemical production, or to announce when their existing stocks would be destroyed. C: Health security is vital to achieving human security, when considering the individual as the referent object of security studies, fatal or potentially fatal infection directly undermines the attainment of security.
