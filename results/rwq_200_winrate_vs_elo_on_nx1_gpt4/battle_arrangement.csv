115,"Ok, we have an intro:

""The Personal Record Matching project is a long-running effort to improve the efficiency of employment data processing. The project uses AI techniques to assign employment events to individuals in a database, resulting in a more accurate and streamlined process. 
The POC has demonstrated significant improvements in both speed and accuracy through the use of AI techniques. Our automated prediction process found matches 100 times faster than the hardcoded algorithm. Additionally, the number of manual checks has been reduced to 10%.
Since the POC, we have processed approximately 200k events and continuously improved the AI model. We have introduced cutting-edge language models that improve matching in cases such as nicknames, mistyped names, and can take emails-name similarity into consideration. Additionally, we have used these language models to improve indexing, allowing for real-time search and matching.

In terms of accuracy, the machine learning (ML) models used in the project have successfully identified previously overlooked matches. Examples of these matches have been provided in the appendix. Additionally, the ML models have improved over time, providing a process for tracking accuracy, identifying errors, and making further improvements.
However, even with these improvements, the current process still runs in batches and can be improved further. There is a clear need to streamline the process, remove blockers and reduce resources required to keep the project running. In the next section, we will propose a solution to close the loop and allow for regular updates to the person and applicant databases.
It is also worth mentioning that this development can potentially be used for other projects as well, such as a partnership with HourWork to help clean and process their data. This is a related project that can benefit from the advancements made in the Personal Record Matching project.
In this document, we will present the current state of the project, the challenges faced and the solution we propose to close the loop, allowing for weekly or even daily processing.""

In the quaint village of Oakwood, you, a druid, were asked by Eadric, the village elder, to investigate the corruption spreading through the Whispering Woods. You spent the night at Innkeeper Alaric's Silver Stag Inn, learning what you could from the locals. The next morning, venturing into the woods, you took on the form of a squirrel to blend in with your surroundings and quickly travel through the forest. Communicating with the spirits of the forest, you discovered a ritual site where a group of goblins was performing a dark ceremony.

You dispatched several goblin lookouts before confronting the remaining goblins, who revealed that a goblin shaman named Kragthar was attempting to control the spirits of the forest using an ancient tome. You persuaded two goblins to help you stop Kragthar and learned that he was at the Moonstone Spire.

Upon arriving at the Moonstone Spire, you observed Kragthar and his hooded followers performing a ritual. You created a wall of fire to scare the followers before charging Kragthar in the form of a Grizzly Bear. After a fierce battle, you emerged victorious and stopped Kragthar's plans, saving the Whispering Woods from corruption. The two goblins were then free to return to their clan, liberated from Kragthar's control.

Inspecting the Moonstone Spire, you found it contained a complex combination of nature-based and arcane symbols, suggesting a deep connection between the two. You surmise that the spire and altar may have once been used for rituals and ceremonies aimed at maintaining balance between the natural and arcane energies within the Whispering Woods.

Returning to Oakwood, you were welcomed as a hero and celebrated for your bravery and resourcefulness. With the Whispering Woods safe once more, you prepared for the next adventure life had in store for you.",gpt-35-turbo,gpt-4-turbo

In the quaint village of Oakwood, you, a druid, were asked by Eadric, the village elder, to investigate the corruption spreading through the Whispering Woods. You spent the night at Innkeeper Alaric's Silver Stag Inn, learning what you could from the locals. The next morning, venturing into the woods, you took on the form of a squirrel to blend in with your surroundings and quickly travel through the forest. Communicating with the spirits of the forest, you discovered a ritual site where a group of goblins was performing a dark ceremony.

You dispatched several goblin lookouts before confronting the remaining goblins, who revealed that a goblin shaman named Kragthar was attempting to control the spirits of the forest using an ancient tome. You persuaded two goblins to help you stop Kragthar and learned that he was at the Moonstone Spire.

Upon arriving at the Moonstone Spire, you observed Kragthar and his hooded followers performing a ritual. You created a wall of fire to scare the followers before charging Kragthar in the form of a Grizzly Bear. After a fierce battle, you emerged victorious and stopped Kragthar's plans, saving the Whispering Woods from corruption. The two goblins were then free to return to their clan, liberated from Kragthar's control.

Inspecting the Moonstone Spire, you found it contained a complex combination of nature-based and arcane symbols, suggesting a deep connection between the two. You surmise that the spire and altar may have once been used for rituals and ceremonies aimed at maintaining balance between the natural and arcane energies within the Whispering Woods.

Returning to Oakwood, you were welcomed as a hero and celebrated for your bravery and resourcefulness. With the Whispering Woods safe once more, you prepared for the next adventure life had in store for you.",lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5,gpt-4-turbo

278,"Ok, we have an intro:

""The Personal Record Matching project is a long-running effort to improve the efficiency of employment data processing. The project uses AI techniques to assign employment events to individuals in a database, resulting in a more accurate and streamlined process. 
The POC has demonstrated significant improvements in both speed and accuracy through the use of AI techniques. Our automated prediction process found matches 100 times faster than the hardcoded algorithm. Additionally, the number of manual checks has been reduced to 10%.
Since the POC, we have processed approximately 200k events and continuously improved the AI model. We have introduced cutting-edge language models that improve matching in cases such as nicknames, mistyped names, and can take emails-name similarity into consideration. Additionally, we have used these language models to improve indexing, allowing for real-time search and matching.

In terms of accuracy, the machine learning (ML) models used in the project have successfully identified previously overlooked matches. Examples of these matches have been provided in the appendix. Additionally, the ML models have improved over time, providing a process for tracking accuracy, identifying errors, and making further improvements.
However, even with these improvements, the current process still runs in batches and can be improved further.

""The Personal Record Matching project is a long-running effort to improve the efficiency of employment data processing. The project uses AI techniques to assign employment events to individuals in a database, resulting in a more accurate and streamlined process. 
The POC has demonstrated significant improvements in both speed and accuracy through the use of AI techniques. Our automated prediction process found matches 100 times faster than the hardcoded algorithm. Additionally, the number of manual checks has been reduced to 10%.
Since the POC, we have processed approximately 200k events and continuously improved the AI model. We have introduced cutting-edge language models that improve matching in cases such as nicknames, mistyped names, and can take emails-name similarity into consideration. Additionally, we have used these language models to improve indexing, allowing for real-time search and matching.

In terms of accuracy, the machine learning (ML) models used in the project have successfully identified previously overlooked matches. Examples of these matches have been provided in the appendix. Additionally, the ML models have improved over time, providing a process for tracking accuracy, identifying errors, and making further improvements.
However, even with these improvements, the current process still runs in batches and can be improved further. There is a clear need to streamline the process, remove blockers and reduce resources required to keep the project running. In the next section, we will propose a solution to close the loop and allow for regular updates to the person and applicant databases.
It is also worth mentioning that this development can potentially be used for other projects as well, such as a partnership with HourWork to help clean and process their data. This is a related project that can benefit from the advancements made in the Personal Record Matching project.
In this document, we will present the current state of the project, the challenges faced and the solution we propose to close the loop, allowing for weekly or even daily processing.""

571,"Based on the following summary of a dungeons and dragons adventure, suggest 10 follow up stories: 

In the quaint village of Oakwood, you, a druid, were asked by Eadric, the village elder, to investigate the corruption spreading through the Whispering Woods. You spent the night at Innkeeper Alaric's Silver Stag Inn, learning what you could from the locals. The next morning, venturing into the woods, you took on the form of a squirrel to blend in with your surroundings and quickly travel through the forest. Communicating with the spirits of the forest, you discovered a ritual site where a group of goblins was performing a dark ceremony.

You dispatched several goblin lookouts before confronting the remaining goblins, who revealed that a goblin shaman named Kragthar was attempting to control the spirits of the forest using an ancient tome. You persuaded two goblins to help you stop Kragthar and learned that he was at the Moonstone Spire.

Upon arriving at the Moonstone Spire, you observed Kragthar and his hooded followers performing a ritual. You created a wall of fire to scare the followers before charging Kragthar in the form of a Grizzly Bear. After a fierce battle, you emerged victorious and stopped Kragthar's plans, saving the Whispering Woods from corruption. The two goblins were then free to return to their clan, liberated from Kragthar's control.

Inspecting the Moonstone Spire, you found it contained a complex combination of nature-based and arcane symbols, suggesting a deep connection between the two. You surmise that the spire and altar may have once been used for rituals and ceremonies aimed at maintaining balance between the natural and arcane energies within the Whispering Woods.

Returning to Oakwood, you were welcomed as a hero and celebrated for your bravery and resourcefulness. With the Whispering Woods safe once more, you prepared for the next adventure life had in store for you.",gpt-4-turbo,lmsys/vicuna-13b-v1.5

In the quaint village of Oakwood, you, a druid, were asked by Eadric, the village elder, to investigate the corruption spreading through the Whispering Woods. You spent the night at Innkeeper Alaric's Silver Stag Inn, learning what you could from the locals. The next morning, venturing into the woods, you took on the form of a squirrel to blend in with your surroundings and quickly travel through the forest. Communicating with the spirits of the forest, you discovered a ritual site where a group of goblins was performing a dark ceremony.

You dispatched several goblin lookouts before confronting the remaining goblins, who revealed that a goblin shaman named Kragthar was attempting to control the spirits of the forest using an ancient tome. You persuaded two goblins to help you stop Kragthar and learned that he was at the Moonstone Spire.

Upon arriving at the Moonstone Spire, you observed Kragthar and his hooded followers performing a ritual. You created a wall of fire to scare the followers before charging Kragthar in the form of a Grizzly Bear. After a fierce battle, you emerged victorious and stopped Kragthar's plans, saving the Whispering Woods from corruption. The two goblins were then free to return to their clan, liberated from Kragthar's control.

Inspecting the Moonstone Spire, you found it contained a complex combination of nature-based and arcane symbols, suggesting a deep connection between the two. You surmise that the spire and altar may have once been used for rituals and ceremonies aimed at maintaining balance between the natural and arcane energies within the Whispering Woods.

Returning to Oakwood, you were welcomed as a hero and celebrated for your bravery and resourcefulness. With the Whispering Woods safe once more, you prepared for the next adventure life had in store for you.",gpt-4-turbo,lmsys/vicuna-33b-v1.3

""The Personal Record Matching project is a long-running effort to improve the efficiency of employment data processing. The project uses AI techniques to assign employment events to individuals in a database, resulting in a more accurate and streamlined process. 
The POC has demonstrated significant improvements in both speed and accuracy through the use of AI techniques. Our automated prediction process found matches 100 times faster than the hardcoded algorithm. Additionally, the number of manual checks has been reduced to 10%.
Since the POC, we have processed approximately 200k events and continuously improved the AI model. We have introduced cutting-edge language models that improve matching in cases such as nicknames, mistyped names, and can take emails-name similarity into consideration. Additionally, we have used these language models to improve indexing, allowing for real-time search and matching.

In terms of accuracy, the machine learning (ML) models used in the project have successfully identified previously overlooked matches. Examples of these matches have been provided in the appendix. Additionally, the ML models have improved over time, providing a process for tracking accuracy, identifying errors, and making further improvements.
However, even with these improvements, the current process still runs in batches and can be improved further. There is a clear need to streamline the process, remove blockers and reduce resources required to keep the project running. In the next section, we will propose a solution to close the loop and allow for regular updates to the person and applicant databases.
It is also worth mentioning that this development can potentially be used for other projects as well, such as a partnership with HourWork to help clean and process their data. This is a related project that can benefit from the advancements made in the Personal Record Matching project.
In this document, we will present the current state of the project, the challenges faced and the solution we propose to close the loop, allowing for weekly or even daily processing.""

We're a week into our trip and this is the quietest I've ever been when hanging out with another person as he rebuffs all my attempts at conversation. He wears his airpods in the car and around the accommodation - not that I've kept trying to talk to him. Honestly, he is bringing some seriously bad vibes to everything and it's ruining my trip.
We don't have anything booked in yet for the South Island, so I'm planning to ditch him in Wellington at the ferry. Probably book my own car in Picton and just relax alone for the rest of the trip. (Just thinking about it is such sharp relief that it makes me feel emotional. I'll pay whatever price I have to just to get away from him.)

987,"Ok, we have an intro:

""The Personal Record Matching project is a long-running effort to improve the efficiency of employment data processing. The project uses AI techniques to assign employment events to individuals in a database, resulting in a more accurate and streamlined process. 
The POC has demonstrated significant improvements in both speed and accuracy through the use of AI techniques. Our automated prediction process found matches 100 times faster than the hardcoded algorithm. Additionally, the number of manual checks has been reduced to 10%.
Since the POC, we have processed approximately 200k events and continuously improved the AI model. We have introduced cutting-edge language models that improve matching in cases such as nicknames, mistyped names, and can take emails-name similarity into consideration. Additionally, we have used these language models to improve indexing, allowing for real-time search and matching.

In terms of accuracy, the machine learning (ML) models used in the project have successfully identified previously overlooked matches. Examples of these matches have been provided in the appendix. Additionally, the ML models have improved over time, providing a process for tracking accuracy, identifying errors, and making further improvements.
However, even with these improvements, the current process still runs in batches and can be improved further. There is a clear need to streamline the process, remove blockers and reduce resources required to keep the project running. In the next section, we will propose a solution to close the loop and allow for regular updates to the person and applicant databases.
It is also worth mentioning that this development can potentially be used for other projects as well, such as a partnership with HourWork to help clean and process their data. This is a related project that can benefit from the advancements made in the Personal Record Matching project.
In this document, we will present the current state of the project, the challenges faced and the solution we propose to close the loop, allowing for weekly or even daily processing.""

In the quaint village of Oakwood, you, a druid, were asked by Eadric, the village elder, to investigate the corruption spreading through the Whispering Woods. You spent the night at Innkeeper Alaric's Silver Stag Inn, learning what you could from the locals. The next morning, venturing into the woods, you took on the form of a squirrel to blend in with your surroundings and quickly travel through the forest. Communicating with the spirits of the forest, you discovered a ritual site where a group of goblins was performing a dark ceremony.

You dispatched several goblin lookouts before confronting the remaining goblins, who revealed that a goblin shaman named Kragthar was attempting to control the spirits of the forest using an ancient tome. You persuaded two goblins to help you stop Kragthar and learned that he was at the Moonstone Spire.

Upon arriving at the Moonstone Spire, you observed Kragthar and his hooded followers performing a ritual. You created a wall of fire to scare the followers before charging Kragthar in the form of a Grizzly Bear. After a fierce battle, you emerged victorious and stopped Kragthar's plans, saving the Whispering Woods from corruption. The two goblins were then free to return to their clan, liberated from Kragthar's control.

Inspecting the Moonstone Spire, you found it contained a complex combination of nature-based and arcane symbols, suggesting a deep connection between the two. You surmise that the spire and altar may have once been used for rituals and ceremonies aimed at maintaining balance between the natural and arcane energies within the Whispering Woods.

Returning to Oakwood, you were welcomed as a hero and celebrated for your bravery and resourcefulness. With the Whispering Woods safe once more, you prepared for the next adventure life had in store for you.",gpt-4-turbo,meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf

1050,"Ok, we have an intro:

""The Personal Record Matching project is a long-running effort to improve the efficiency of employment data processing. The project uses AI techniques to assign employment events to individuals in a database, resulting in a more accurate and streamlined process. 
The POC has demonstrated significant improvements in both speed and accuracy through the use of AI techniques. Our automated prediction process found matches 100 times faster than the hardcoded algorithm. Additionally, the number of manual checks has been reduced to 10%.
Since the POC, we have processed approximately 200k events and continuously improved the AI model. We have introduced cutting-edge language models that improve matching in cases such as nicknames, mistyped names, and can take emails-name similarity into consideration. Additionally, we have used these language models to improve indexing, allowing for real-time search and matching.

In terms of accuracy, the machine learning (ML) models used in the project have successfully identified previously overlooked matches. Examples of these matches have been provided in the appendix. Additionally, the ML models have improved over time, providing a process for tracking accuracy, identifying errors, and making further improvements.
However, even with these improvements, the current process still runs in batches and can be improved further. There is a clear need to streamline the process, remove blockers and reduce resources required to keep the project running. In the next section, we will propose a solution to close the loop and allow for regular updates to the person and applicant databases.
It is also worth mentioning that this development can potentially be used for other projects as well, such as a partnership with HourWork to help clean and process their data. This is a related project that can benefit from the advancements made in the Personal Record Matching project.
In this document, we will present the current state of the project, the challenges faced and the solution we propose to close the loop, allowing for weekly or even daily processing.""

1073,"Based on the following summary of a dungeons and dragons adventure, suggest 10 follow up stories: 

In the quaint village of Oakwood, you, a druid, were asked by Eadric, the village elder, to investigate the corruption spreading through the Whispering Woods. You spent the night at Innkeeper Alaric's Silver Stag Inn, learning what you could from the locals. The next morning, venturing into the woods, you took on the form of a squirrel to blend in with your surroundings and quickly travel through the forest. Communicating with the spirits of the forest, you discovered a ritual site where a group of goblins was performing a dark ceremony.

You dispatched several goblin lookouts before confronting the remaining goblins, who revealed that a goblin shaman named Kragthar was attempting to control the spirits of the forest using an ancient tome. You persuaded two goblins to help you stop Kragthar and learned that he was at the Moonstone Spire.

Upon arriving at the Moonstone Spire, you observed Kragthar and his hooded followers performing a ritual. You created a wall of fire to scare the followers before charging Kragthar in the form of a Grizzly Bear. After a fierce battle, you emerged victorious and stopped Kragthar's plans, saving the Whispering Woods from corruption. The two goblins were then free to return to their clan, liberated from Kragthar's control.

Inspecting the Moonstone Spire, you found it contained a complex combination of nature-based and arcane symbols, suggesting a deep connection between the two. You surmise that the spire and altar may have once been used for rituals and ceremonies aimed at maintaining balance between the natural and arcane energies within the Whispering Woods.

Returning to Oakwood, you were welcomed as a hero and celebrated for your bravery and resourcefulness. With the Whispering Woods safe once more, you prepared for the next adventure life had in store for you.",meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf,gpt-4-turbo

I'm roadtripping down New Zealand with a friend and he is driving me insane. He hasn't enjoyed all the tours we've been on and doesn't want to chat about ANYTHING. We're a week into our trip and this is the quietest I've ever been when hanging out with another person as he rebuffs all my attempts at conversation. He wears his airpods in the car and around the accommodation - not that I've kept trying to talk to him. Honestly, he is bringing some seriously bad vibes to everything and it's ruining my trip.
We don't have anything booked in yet for the South Island, so I'm planning to ditch him in Wellington at the ferry. Probably book my own car in Picton and just relax alone for the rest of the trip. (Just thinking about it is such sharp relief that it makes me feel emotional. I'll pay whatever price I have to just to get away from him.)

""The Personal Record Matching project is a long-running effort to improve the efficiency of employment data processing. The project uses AI techniques to assign employment events to individuals in a database, resulting in a more accurate and streamlined process. 
The POC has demonstrated significant improvements in both speed and accuracy through the use of AI techniques. Our automated prediction process found matches 100 times faster than the hardcoded algorithm. Additionally, the number of manual checks has been reduced to 10%.
Since the POC, we have processed approximately 200k events and continuously improved the AI model. We have introduced cutting-edge language models that improve matching in cases such as nicknames, mistyped names, and can take emails-name similarity into consideration. Additionally, we have used these language models to improve indexing, allowing for real-time search and matching.

In terms of accuracy, the machine learning (ML) models used in the project have successfully identified previously overlooked matches. Examples of these matches have been provided in the appendix. Additionally, the ML models have improved over time, providing a process for tracking accuracy, identifying errors, and making further improvements.
However, even with these improvements, the current process still runs in batches and can be improved further. There is a clear need to streamline the process, remove blockers and reduce resources required to keep the project running. In the next section, we will propose a solution to close the loop and allow for regular updates to the person and applicant databases.
It is also worth mentioning that this development can potentially be used for other projects as well, such as a partnership with HourWork to help clean and process their data. This is a related project that can benefit from the advancements made in the Personal Record Matching project.
In this document, we will present the current state of the project, the challenges faced and the solution we propose to close the loop, allowing for weekly or even daily processing.""

In the quaint village of Oakwood, you, a druid, were asked by Eadric, the village elder, to investigate the corruption spreading through the Whispering Woods. You spent the night at Innkeeper Alaric's Silver Stag Inn, learning what you could from the locals. The next morning, venturing into the woods, you took on the form of a squirrel to blend in with your surroundings and quickly travel through the forest. Communicating with the spirits of the forest, you discovered a ritual site where a group of goblins was performing a dark ceremony.

You dispatched several goblin lookouts before confronting the remaining goblins, who revealed that a goblin shaman named Kragthar was attempting to control the spirits of the forest using an ancient tome. You persuaded two goblins to help you stop Kragthar and learned that he was at the Moonstone Spire.

Upon arriving at the Moonstone Spire, you observed Kragthar and his hooded followers performing a ritual. You created a wall of fire to scare the followers before charging Kragthar in the form of a Grizzly Bear. After a fierce battle, you emerged victorious and stopped Kragthar's plans, saving the Whispering Woods from corruption. The two goblins were then free to return to their clan, liberated from Kragthar's control.

Inspecting the Moonstone Spire, you found it contained a complex combination of nature-based and arcane symbols, suggesting a deep connection between the two. You surmise that the spire and altar may have once been used for rituals and ceremonies aimed at maintaining balance between the natural and arcane energies within the Whispering Woods.

Returning to Oakwood, you were welcomed as a hero and celebrated for your bravery and resourcefulness. With the Whispering Woods safe once more, you prepared for the next adventure life had in store for you.",gpt-4-turbo,meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf

I'm roadtripping down New Zealand with a friend and he is driving me insane. He hasn't enjoyed all the tours we've been on and doesn't want to chat about ANYTHING. We're a week into our trip and this is the quietest I've ever been when hanging out with another person as he rebuffs all my attempts at conversation.

We don't have anything booked in yet for the South Island, so I'm planning to ditch him in Wellington at the ferry. Probably book my own car in Picton and just relax alone for the rest of the trip.

In the quaint village of Oakwood, you, a druid, were asked by Eadric, the village elder, to investigate the corruption spreading through the Whispering Woods. You spent the night at Innkeeper Alaric's Silver Stag Inn, learning what you could from the locals. The next morning, venturing into the woods, you took on the form of a squirrel to blend in with your surroundings and quickly travel through the forest. Communicating with the spirits of the forest, you discovered a ritual site where a group of goblins was performing a dark ceremony.

You dispatched several goblin lookouts before confronting the remaining goblins, who revealed that a goblin shaman named Kragthar was attempting to control the spirits of the forest using an ancient tome. You persuaded two goblins to help you stop Kragthar and learned that he was at the Moonstone Spire.

Upon arriving at the Moonstone Spire, you observed Kragthar and his hooded followers performing a ritual. You created a wall of fire to scare the followers before charging Kragthar in the form of a Grizzly Bear. After a fierce battle, you emerged victorious and stopped Kragthar's plans, saving the Whispering Woods from corruption. The two goblins were then free to return to their clan, liberated from Kragthar's control.

Inspecting the Moonstone Spire, you found it contained a complex combination of nature-based and arcane symbols, suggesting a deep connection between the two. You surmise that the spire and altar may have once been used for rituals and ceremonies aimed at maintaining balance between the natural and arcane energies within the Whispering Woods.

Returning to Oakwood, you were welcomed as a hero and celebrated for your bravery and resourcefulness. With the Whispering Woods safe once more, you prepared for the next adventure life had in store for you.",gpt-4-turbo,chavinlo/alpaca-native

""The Personal Record Matching project is a long-running effort to improve the efficiency of employment data processing. The project uses AI techniques to assign employment events to individuals in a database, resulting in a more accurate and streamlined process. 
The POC has demonstrated significant improvements in both speed and accuracy through the use of AI techniques. Our automated prediction process found matches 100 times faster than the hardcoded algorithm. Additionally, the number of manual checks has been reduced to 10%.
Since the POC, we have processed approximately 200k events and continuously improved the AI model. We have introduced cutting-edge language models that improve matching in cases such as nicknames, mistyped names, and can take emails-name similarity into consideration. Additionally, we have used these language models to improve indexing, allowing for real-time search and matching.

In terms of accuracy, the machine learning (ML) models used in the project have successfully identified previously overlooked matches. Examples of these matches have been provided in the appendix. Additionally, the ML models have improved over time, providing a process for tracking accuracy, identifying errors, and making further improvements.
However, even with these improvements, the current process still runs in batches and can be improved further. There is a clear need to streamline the process, remove blockers and reduce resources required to keep the project running. In the next section, we will propose a solution to close the loop and allow for regular updates to the person and applicant databases.
It is also worth mentioning that this development can potentially be used for other projects as well, such as a partnership with HourWork to help clean and process their data. This is a related project that can benefit from the advancements made in the Personal Record Matching project.
In this document, we will present the current state of the project, the challenges faced and the solution we propose to close the loop, allowing for weekly or even daily processing.""

In the quaint village of Oakwood, you, a druid, were asked by Eadric, the village elder, to investigate the corruption spreading through the Whispering Woods. You spent the night at Innkeeper Alaric's Silver Stag Inn, learning what you could from the locals. The next morning, venturing into the woods, you took on the form of a squirrel to blend in with your surroundings and quickly travel through the forest. Communicating with the spirits of the forest, you discovered a ritual site where a group of goblins was performing a dark ceremony.

You dispatched several goblin lookouts before confronting the remaining goblins, who revealed that a goblin shaman named Kragthar was attempting to control the spirits of the forest using an ancient tome. You persuaded two goblins to help you stop Kragthar and learned that he was at the Moonstone Spire.

Upon arriving at the Moonstone Spire, you observed Kragthar and his hooded followers performing a ritual. You created a wall of fire to scare the followers before charging Kragthar in the form of a Grizzly Bear. After a fierce battle, you emerged victorious and stopped Kragthar's plans, saving the Whispering Woods from corruption. The two goblins were then free to return to their clan, liberated from Kragthar's control.

Inspecting the Moonstone Spire, you found it contained a complex combination of nature-based and arcane symbols, suggesting a deep connection between the two. You surmise that the spire and altar may have once been used for rituals and ceremonies aimed at maintaining balance between the natural and arcane energies within the Whispering Woods.

Returning to Oakwood, you were welcomed as a hero and celebrated for your bravery and resourcefulness. With the Whispering Woods safe once more, you prepared for the next adventure life had in store for you.",gpt-4-turbo,chavinlo/alpaca-13b

""The Personal Record Matching project is a long-running effort to improve the efficiency of employment data processing. The project uses AI techniques to assign employment events to individuals in a database, resulting in a more accurate and streamlined process. 
The POC has demonstrated significant improvements in both speed and accuracy through the use of AI techniques. Our automated prediction process found matches 100 times faster than the hardcoded algorithm. Additionally, the number of manual checks has been reduced to 10%.
Since the POC, we have processed approximately 200k events and continuously improved the AI model. We have introduced cutting-edge language models that improve matching in cases such as nicknames, mistyped names, and can take emails-name similarity into consideration. Additionally, we have used these language models to improve indexing, allowing for real-time search and matching.

In terms of accuracy, the machine learning (ML) models used in the project have successfully identified previously overlooked matches. Examples of these matches have been provided in the appendix. Additionally, the ML models have improved over time, providing a process for tracking accuracy, identifying errors, and making further improvements.
However, even with these improvements, the current process still runs in batches and can be improved further. There is a clear need to streamline the process, remove blockers and reduce resources required to keep the project running. In the next section, we will propose a solution to close the loop and allow for regular updates to the person and applicant databases.
It is also worth mentioning that this development can potentially be used for other projects as well, such as a partnership with HourWork to help clean and process their data. This is a related project that can benefit from the advancements made in the Personal Record Matching project.
In this document, we will present the current state of the project, the challenges faced and the solution we propose to close the loop, allowing for weekly or even daily processing.""

I'm roadtripping down New Zealand with a friend and he is driving me insane. He hasn't enjoyed all the tours we've been on and doesn't want to chat about ANYTHING. We're a week into our trip and this is the quietest I've ever been when hanging out with another person as he rebuffs all my attempts at conversation. He wears his airpods in the car and around the accommodation - not that I've kept trying to talk to him. Honestly, he is bringing some seriously bad vibes to everything and it's ruining my trip.
We don't have anything booked in yet for the South Island, so I'm planning to ditch him in Wellington at the ferry. Probably book my own car in Picton and just relax alone for the rest of the trip. (Just thinking about it is such sharp relief that it makes me feel emotional. I'll pay whatever price I have to just to get away from him.)

""The Personal Record Matching project is a long-running effort to improve the efficiency of employment data processing. The project uses AI techniques to assign employment events to individuals in a database, resulting in a more accurate and streamlined process. 
The POC has demonstrated significant improvements in both speed and accuracy through the use of AI techniques. Our automated prediction process found matches 100 times faster than the hardcoded algorithm. Additionally, the number of manual checks has been reduced to 10%.
Since the POC, we have processed approximately 200k events and continuously improved the AI model. We have introduced cutting-edge language models that improve matching in cases such as nicknames, mistyped names, and can take emails-name similarity into consideration. Additionally, we have used these language models to improve indexing, allowing for real-time search and matching.

In terms of accuracy, the machine learning (ML) models used in the project have successfully identified previously overlooked matches. Examples of these matches have been provided in the appendix. Additionally, the ML models have improved over time, providing a process for tracking accuracy, identifying errors, and making further improvements.
However, even with these improvements, the current process still runs in batches and can be improved further. There is a clear need to streamline the process, remove blockers and reduce resources required to keep the project running. In the next section, we will propose a solution to close the loop and allow for regular updates to the person and applicant databases.
It is also worth mentioning that this development can potentially be used for other projects as well, such as a partnership with HourWork to help clean and process their data. This is a related project that can benefit from the advancements made in the Personal Record Matching project.
In this document, we will present the current state of the project, the challenges faced and the solution we propose to close the loop, allowing for weekly or even daily processing.""

In the quaint village of Oakwood, you, a druid, were asked by Eadric, the village elder, to investigate the corruption spreading through the Whispering Woods. You spent the night at Innkeeper Alaric's Silver Stag Inn, learning what you could from the locals. The next morning, venturing into the woods, you took on the form of a squirrel to blend in with your surroundings and quickly travel through the forest. Communicating with the spirits of the forest, you discovered a ritual site where a group of goblins was performing a dark ceremony.

You dispatched several goblin lookouts before confronting the remaining goblins, who revealed that a goblin shaman named Kragthar was attempting to control the spirits of the forest using an ancient tome. You persuaded two goblins to help you stop Kragthar and learned that he was at the Moonstone Spire.

Upon arriving at the Moonstone Spire, you observed Kragthar and his hooded followers performing a ritual. You created a wall of fire to scare the followers before charging Kragthar in the form of a Grizzly Bear. After a fierce battle, you emerged victorious and stopped Kragthar's plans, saving the Whispering Woods from corruption. The two goblins were then free to return to their clan, liberated from Kragthar's control.

Inspecting the Moonstone Spire, you found it contained a complex combination of nature-based and arcane symbols, suggesting a deep connection between the two. You surmise that the spire and altar may have once been used for rituals and ceremonies aimed at maintaining balance between the natural and arcane energies within the Whispering Woods.

Returning to Oakwood, you were welcomed as a hero and celebrated for your bravery and resourcefulness. With the Whispering Woods safe once more, you prepared for the next adventure life had in store for you.",mosaicml/mpt-7b-chat,gpt-4-turbo

Since the POC, we have processed approximately 200k events and continuously improved the AI model. We have introduced cutting-edge language models that improve matching in cases such as nicknames, mistyped names, and can take emails-name similarity into consideration. Additionally, we have used these language models to improve indexing, allowing for real-time search and matching.

In terms of accuracy, the machine learning (ML) models used in the project have successfully identified previously overlooked matches. Examples of these matches have been provided in the appendix. Additionally, the ML models have improved over time, providing a process for tracking accuracy, identifying errors, and making further improvements.
However, even with these improvements, the current process still runs in batches and can be improved further. There is a clear need to streamline the process, remove blockers and reduce resources required to keep the project running. In the next section, we will propose a solution to close the loop and allow for regular updates to the person and applicant databases.
It is also worth mentioning that this development can potentially be used for other projects as well, such as a partnership with HourWork to help clean and process their data. This is a related project that can benefit from the advancements made in the Personal Record Matching project.
In this document, we will present the current state of the project, the challenges faced and the solution we propose to close the loop, allowing for weekly or even daily processing.""

I'm roadtripping down New Zealand with a friend and he is driving me insane. He hasn't enjoyed all the tours we've been on and doesn't want to chat about ANYTHING. We're a week into our trip and this is the quietest I've ever been when hanging out with another person as he rebuffs all my attempts at conversation. He wears his airpods in the car and around the accommodation - not that I've kept trying to talk to him. Honestly, he is bringing some seriously bad vibes to everything and it's ruining my trip.
We don't have anything booked in yet for the South Island, so I'm planning to ditch him in Wellington at the ferry. Probably book my own car in Picton and just relax alone for the rest of the trip. (Just thinking about it is such sharp relief that it makes me feel emotional. I'll pay whatever price I have to just to get away from him.)

In the quaint village of Oakwood, you, a druid, were asked by Eadric, the village elder, to investigate the corruption spreading through the Whispering Woods. You spent the night at Innkeeper Alaric's Silver Stag Inn, learning what you could from the locals. The next morning, venturing into the woods, you took on the form of a squirrel to blend in with your surroundings and quickly travel through the forest. Communicating with the spirits of the forest, you discovered a ritual site where a group of goblins was performing a dark ceremony.

You dispatched several goblin lookouts before confronting the remaining goblins, who revealed that a goblin shaman named Kragthar was attempting to control the spirits of the forest using an ancient tome. You persuaded two goblins to help you stop Kragthar and learned that he was at the Moonstone Spire.

Upon arriving at the Moonstone Spire, you observed Kragthar and his hooded followers performing a ritual. You created a wall of fire to scare the followers before charging Kragthar in the form of a Grizzly Bear. After a fierce battle, you emerged victorious and stopped Kragthar's plans, saving the Whispering Woods from corruption. The two goblins were then free to return to their clan, liberated from Kragthar's control.

Inspecting the Moonstone Spire, you found it contained a complex combination of nature-based and arcane symbols, suggesting a deep connection between the two. You surmise that the spire and altar may have once been used for rituals and ceremonies aimed at maintaining balance between the natural and arcane energies within the Whispering Woods.

Returning to Oakwood, you were welcomed as a hero and celebrated for your bravery and resourcefulness. With the Whispering Woods safe once more, you prepared for the next adventure life had in store for you.",mosaicml/mpt-30b-chat,gpt-4-turbo

We're a week into our trip and this is the quietest I've ever been when hanging out with another person as he rebuffs all my attempts at conversation.

""The Personal Record Matching project is a long-running effort to improve the efficiency of employment data processing. The project uses AI techniques to assign employment events to individuals in a database, resulting in a more accurate and streamlined process. 
The POC has demonstrated significant improvements in both speed and accuracy through the use of AI techniques. Our automated prediction process found matches 100 times faster than the hardcoded algorithm. Additionally, the number of manual checks has been reduced to 10%.
Since the POC, we have processed approximately 200k events and continuously improved the AI model. We have introduced cutting-edge language models that improve matching in cases such as nicknames, mistyped names, and can take emails-name similarity into consideration. Additionally, we have used these language models to improve indexing, allowing for real-time search and matching.

In terms of accuracy, the machine learning (ML) models used in the project have successfully identified previously overlooked matches. Examples of these matches have been provided in the appendix. Additionally, the ML models have improved over time, providing a process for tracking accuracy, identifying errors, and making further improvements.
However, even with these improvements, the current process still runs in batches and can be improved further. There is a clear need to streamline the process, remove blockers and reduce resources required to keep the project running. In the next section, we will propose a solution to close the loop and allow for regular updates to the person and applicant databases.
It is also worth mentioning that this development can potentially be used for other projects as well, such as a partnership with HourWork to help clean and process their data. This is a related project that can benefit from the advancements made in the Personal Record Matching project.
In this document, we will present the current state of the project, the challenges faced and the solution we propose to close the loop, allowing for weekly or even daily processing.""

In the quaint village of Oakwood, you, a druid, were asked by Eadric, the village elder, to investigate the corruption spreading through the Whispering Woods. You spent the night at Innkeeper Alaric's Silver Stag Inn, learning what you could from the locals. The next morning, venturing into the woods, you took on the form of a squirrel to blend in with your surroundings and quickly travel through the forest. Communicating with the spirits of the forest, you discovered a ritual site where a group of goblins was performing a dark ceremony.

You dispatched several goblin lookouts before confronting the remaining goblins, who revealed that a goblin shaman named Kragthar was attempting to control the spirits of the forest using an ancient tome. You persuaded two goblins to help you stop Kragthar and learned that he was at the Moonstone Spire.

Upon arriving at the Moonstone Spire, you observed Kragthar and his hooded followers performing a ritual. You created a wall of fire to scare the followers before charging Kragthar in the form of a Grizzly Bear. After a fierce battle, you emerged victorious and stopped Kragthar's plans, saving the Whispering Woods from corruption. The two goblins were then free to return to their clan, liberated from Kragthar's control.

Inspecting the Moonstone Spire, you found it contained a complex combination of nature-based and arcane symbols, suggesting a deep connection between the two.

""The Personal Record Matching project is a long-running effort to improve the efficiency of employment data processing. The project uses AI techniques to assign employment events to individuals in a database, resulting in a more accurate and streamlined process. 
The POC has demonstrated significant improvements in both speed and accuracy through the use of AI techniques. Our automated prediction process found matches 100 times faster than the hardcoded algorithm. Additionally, the number of manual checks has been reduced to 10%.
Since the POC, we have processed approximately 200k events and continuously improved the AI model. We have introduced cutting-edge language models that improve matching in cases such as nicknames, mistyped names, and can take emails-name similarity into consideration. Additionally, we have used these language models to improve indexing, allowing for real-time search and matching.

In terms of accuracy, the machine learning (ML) models used in the project have successfully identified previously overlooked matches. Examples of these matches have been provided in the appendix. Additionally, the ML models have improved over time, providing a process for tracking accuracy, identifying errors, and making further improvements.
However, even with these improvements, the current process still runs in batches and can be improved further. There is a clear need to streamline the process, remove blockers and reduce resources required to keep the project running. In the next section, we will propose a solution to close the loop and allow for regular updates to the person and applicant databases.
It is also worth mentioning that this development can potentially be used for other projects as well, such as a partnership with HourWork to help clean and process their data. This is a related project that can benefit from the advancements made in the Personal Record Matching project.
In this document, we will present the current state of the project, the challenges faced and the solution we propose to close the loop, allowing for weekly or even daily processing.""

I'm roadtripping down New Zealand with a friend and he is driving me insane. He hasn't enjoyed all the tours we've been on and doesn't want to chat about ANYTHING. We're a week into our trip and this is the quietest I've ever been when hanging out with another person as he rebuffs all my attempts at conversation. He wears his airpods in the car and around the accommodation - not that I've kept trying to talk to him. Honestly, he is bringing some seriously bad vibes to everything and it's ruining my trip.
We don't have anything booked in yet for the South Island, so I'm planning to ditch him in Wellington at the ferry. Probably book my own car in Picton and just relax alone for the rest of the trip.

In the quaint village of Oakwood, you, a druid, were asked by Eadric, the village elder, to investigate the corruption spreading through the Whispering Woods. You spent the night at Innkeeper Alaric's Silver Stag Inn, learning what you could from the locals. The next morning, venturing into the woods, you took on the form of a squirrel to blend in with your surroundings and quickly travel through the forest. Communicating with the spirits of the forest, you discovered a ritual site where a group of goblins was performing a dark ceremony.

You dispatched several goblin lookouts before confronting the remaining goblins, who revealed that a goblin shaman named Kragthar was attempting to control the spirits of the forest using an ancient tome. You persuaded two goblins to help you stop Kragthar and learned that he was at the Moonstone Spire.

Upon arriving at the Moonstone Spire, you observed Kragthar and his hooded followers performing a ritual. You created a wall of fire to scare the followers before charging Kragthar in the form of a Grizzly Bear. After a fierce battle, you emerged victorious and stopped Kragthar's plans, saving the Whispering Woods from corruption. The two goblins were then free to return to their clan, liberated from Kragthar's control.

Inspecting the Moonstone Spire, you found it contained a complex combination of nature-based and arcane symbols, suggesting a deep connection between the two. You surmise that the spire and altar may have once been used for rituals and ceremonies aimed at maintaining balance between the natural and arcane energies within the Whispering Woods.

Returning to Oakwood, you were welcomed as a hero and celebrated for your bravery and resourcefulness. With the Whispering Woods safe once more, you prepared for the next adventure life had in store for you.",gpt-4-turbo,WizardLM/WizardLM-13B-V1.2

""The Personal Record Matching project is a long-running effort to improve the efficiency of employment data processing. The project uses AI techniques to assign employment events to individuals in a database, resulting in a more accurate and streamlined process. 
The POC has demonstrated significant improvements in both speed and accuracy through the use of AI techniques. Our automated prediction process found matches 100 times faster than the hardcoded algorithm. Additionally, the number of manual checks has been reduced to 10%.
Since the POC, we have processed approximately 200k events and continuously improved the AI model. We have introduced cutting-edge language models that improve matching in cases such as nicknames, mistyped names, and can take emails-name similarity into consideration. Additionally, we have used these language models to improve indexing, allowing for real-time search and matching.

In terms of accuracy, the machine learning (ML) models used in the project have successfully identified previously overlooked matches. Examples of these matches have been provided in the appendix. Additionally, the ML models have improved over time, providing a process for tracking accuracy, identifying errors, and making further improvements.
However, even with these improvements, the current process still runs in batches and can be improved further. There is a clear need to streamline the process, remove blockers and reduce resources required to keep the project running. In the next section, we will propose a solution to close the loop and allow for regular updates to the person and applicant databases.
It is also worth mentioning that this development can potentially be used for other projects as well, such as a partnership with HourWork to help clean and process their data. This is a related project that can benefit from the advancements made in the Personal Record Matching project.
In this document, we will present the current state of the project, the challenges faced and the solution we propose to close the loop, allowing for weekly or even daily processing.""

2698,"Based on the following summary of a dungeons and dragons adventure, suggest 10 follow up stories: 

In the quaint village of Oakwood, you, a druid, were asked by Eadric, the village elder, to investigate the corruption spreading through the Whispering Woods. You spent the night at Innkeeper Alaric's Silver Stag Inn, learning what you could from the locals. The next morning, venturing into the woods, you took on the form of a squirrel to blend in with your surroundings and quickly travel through the forest. Communicating with the spirits of the forest, you discovered a ritual site where a group of goblins was performing a dark ceremony.

You dispatched several goblin lookouts before confronting the remaining goblins, who revealed that a goblin shaman named Kragthar was attempting to control the spirits of the forest using an ancient tome. You persuaded two goblins to help you stop Kragthar and learned that he was at the Moonstone Spire.

Upon arriving at the Moonstone Spire, you observed Kragthar and his hooded followers performing a ritual. You created a wall of fire to scare the followers before charging Kragthar in the form of a Grizzly Bear. After a fierce battle, you emerged victorious and stopped Kragthar's plans, saving the Whispering Woods from corruption. The two goblins were then free to return to their clan, liberated from Kragthar's control.

Inspecting the Moonstone Spire, you found it contained a complex combination of nature-based and arcane symbols, suggesting a deep connection between the two. You surmise that the spire and altar may have once been used for rituals and ceremonies aimed at maintaining balance between the natural and arcane energies within the Whispering Woods.

Returning to Oakwood, you were welcomed as a hero and celebrated for your bravery and resourcefulness. With the Whispering Woods safe once more, you prepared for the next adventure life had in store for you.",Xwin-LM/Xwin-LM-7B-V0.1,gpt-4-turbo

2823,"You should take the time to read the situation and problem carefully and give the best advice you can.

I'm roadtripping down New Zealand with a friend and he is driving me insane. He hasn't enjoyed all the tours we've been on and doesn't want to chat about ANYTHING. We're a week into our trip and this is the quietest I've ever been when hanging out with another person as he rebuffs all my attempts at conversation. He wears his airpods in the car and around the accommodation - not that I've kept trying to talk to him. Honestly, he is bringing some seriously bad vibes to everything and it's ruining my trip.
We don't have anything booked in yet for the South Island, so I'm planning to ditch him in Wellington at the ferry. Probably book my own car in Picton and just relax alone for the rest of the trip. (Just thinking about it is such sharp relief that it makes me feel emotional. I'll pay whatever price I have to just to get away from him.)
Obviously telling him he is ruining my trip with his negative energy isn't the best way to approach this.

2933,"Based on the following summary of a dungeons and dragons adventure, suggest 10 follow up stories: 

In the quaint village of Oakwood, you, a druid, were asked by Eadric, the village elder, to investigate the corruption spreading through the Whispering Woods. You spent the night at Innkeeper Alaric's Silver Stag Inn, learning what you could from the locals. The next morning, venturing into the woods, you took on the form of a squirrel to blend in with your surroundings and quickly travel through the forest. Communicating with the spirits of the forest, you discovered a ritual site where a group of goblins was performing a dark ceremony.

You dispatched several goblin lookouts before confronting the remaining goblins, who revealed that a goblin shaman named Kragthar was attempting to control the spirits of the forest using an ancient tome. You persuaded two goblins to help you stop Kragthar and learned that he was at the Moonstone Spire.

Upon arriving at the Moonstone Spire, you observed Kragthar and his hooded followers performing a ritual. You created a wall of fire to scare the followers before charging Kragthar in the form of a Grizzly Bear. After a fierce battle, you emerged victorious and stopped Kragthar's plans, saving the Whispering Woods from corruption. The two goblins were then free to return to their clan, liberated from Kragthar's control.

""The Personal Record Matching project is a long-running effort to improve the efficiency of employment data processing. The project uses AI techniques to assign employment events to individuals in a database, resulting in a more accurate and streamlined process. 
The POC has demonstrated significant improvements in both speed and accuracy through the use of AI techniques. Our automated prediction process found matches 100 times faster than the hardcoded algorithm. Additionally, the number of manual checks has been reduced to 10%.
Since the POC, we have processed approximately 200k events and continuously improved the AI model. We have introduced cutting-edge language models that improve matching in cases such as nicknames, mistyped names, and can take emails-name similarity into consideration. Additionally, we have used these language models to improve indexing, allowing for real-time search and matching.

In terms of accuracy, the machine learning (ML) models used in the project have successfully identified previously overlooked matches. Examples of these matches have been provided in the appendix. Additionally, the ML models have improved over time, providing a process for tracking accuracy, identifying errors, and making further improvements.
However, even with these improvements, the current process still runs in batches and can be improved further. There is a clear need to streamline the process, remove blockers and reduce resources required to keep the project running. In the next section, we will propose a solution to close the loop and allow for regular updates to the person and applicant databases.
It is also worth mentioning that this development can potentially be used for other projects as well, such as a partnership with HourWork to help clean and process their data. This is a related project that can benefit from the advancements made in the Personal Record Matching project.
In this document, we will present the current state of the project, the challenges faced and the solution we propose to close the loop, allowing for weekly or even daily processing.""

In the quaint village of Oakwood, you, a druid, were asked by Eadric, the village elder, to investigate the corruption spreading through the Whispering Woods. You spent the night at Innkeeper Alaric's Silver Stag Inn, learning what you could from the locals. The next morning, venturing into the woods, you took on the form of a squirrel to blend in with your surroundings and quickly travel through the forest. Communicating with the spirits of the forest, you discovered a ritual site where a group of goblins was performing a dark ceremony.

You dispatched several goblin lookouts before confronting the remaining goblins, who revealed that a goblin shaman named Kragthar was attempting to control the spirits of the forest using an ancient tome. You persuaded two goblins to help you stop Kragthar and learned that he was at the Moonstone Spire.

Upon arriving at the Moonstone Spire, you observed Kragthar and his hooded followers performing a ritual. You created a wall of fire to scare the followers before charging Kragthar in the form of a Grizzly Bear. After a fierce battle, you emerged victorious and stopped Kragthar's plans, saving the Whispering Woods from corruption. The two goblins were then free to return to their clan, liberated from Kragthar's control.

Inspecting the Moonstone Spire, you found it contained a complex combination of nature-based and arcane symbols, suggesting a deep connection between the two. You surmise that the spire and altar may have once been used for rituals and ceremonies aimed at maintaining balance between the natural and arcane energies within the Whispering Woods.

Returning to Oakwood, you were welcomed as a hero and celebrated for your bravery and resourcefulness. With the Whispering Woods safe once more, you prepared for the next adventure life had in store for you.",tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct,gpt-4-turbo

He wears his airpods in the car and around the accommodation - not that I've kept trying to talk to him. Honestly, he is bringing some seriously bad vibes to everything and it's ruining my trip.
We don't have anything booked in yet for the South Island, so I'm planning to ditch him in Wellington at the ferry. Probably book my own car in Picton and just relax alone for the rest of the trip. (Just thinking about it is such sharp relief that it makes me feel emotional. I'll pay whatever price I have to just to get away from him.)
Obviously telling him he is ruining my trip with his negative energy isn't the best way to approach this.
Any advice for the best approach so we can split amicably? Or at least not have an argument that ends with very hurt feelings?",tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct,gpt-4-turbo

""The Personal Record Matching project is a long-running effort to improve the efficiency of employment data processing. The project uses AI techniques to assign employment events to individuals in a database, resulting in a more accurate and streamlined process. 
The POC has demonstrated significant improvements in both speed and accuracy through the use of AI techniques. Our automated prediction process found matches 100 times faster than the hardcoded algorithm. Additionally, the number of manual checks has been reduced to 10%.
Since the POC, we have processed approximately 200k events and continuously improved the AI model. We have introduced cutting-edge language models that improve matching in cases such as nicknames, mistyped names, and can take emails-name similarity into consideration. Additionally, we have used these language models to improve indexing, allowing for real-time search and matching.

In terms of accuracy, the machine learning (ML) models used in the project have successfully identified previously overlooked matches. Examples of these matches have been provided in the appendix. Additionally, the ML models have improved over time, providing a process for tracking accuracy, identifying errors, and making further improvements.
However, even with these improvements, the current process still runs in batches and can be improved further. There is a clear need to streamline the process, remove blockers and reduce resources required to keep the project running. In the next section, we will propose a solution to close the loop and allow for regular updates to the person and applicant databases.
It is also worth mentioning that this development can potentially be used for other projects as well, such as a partnership with HourWork to help clean and process their data. This is a related project that can benefit from the advancements made in the Personal Record Matching project.
In this document, we will present the current state of the project, the challenges faced and the solution we propose to close the loop, allowing for weekly or even daily processing.""

In the quaint village of Oakwood, you, a druid, were asked by Eadric, the village elder, to investigate the corruption spreading through the Whispering Woods. You spent the night at Innkeeper Alaric's Silver Stag Inn, learning what you could from the locals. The next morning, venturing into the woods, you took on the form of a squirrel to blend in with your surroundings and quickly travel through the forest. Communicating with the spirits of the forest, you discovered a ritual site where a group of goblins was performing a dark ceremony.

You dispatched several goblin lookouts before confronting the remaining goblins, who revealed that a goblin shaman named Kragthar was attempting to control the spirits of the forest using an ancient tome. You persuaded two goblins to help you stop Kragthar and learned that he was at the Moonstone Spire.

Upon arriving at the Moonstone Spire, you observed Kragthar and his hooded followers performing a ritual. You created a wall of fire to scare the followers before charging Kragthar in the form of a Grizzly Bear. After a fierce battle, you emerged victorious and stopped Kragthar's plans, saving the Whispering Woods from corruption. The two goblins were then free to return to their clan, liberated from Kragthar's control.

Inspecting the Moonstone Spire, you found it contained a complex combination of nature-based and arcane symbols, suggesting a deep connection between the two. You surmise that the spire and altar may have once been used for rituals and ceremonies aimed at maintaining balance between the natural and arcane energies within the Whispering Woods.

Returning to Oakwood, you were welcomed as a hero and celebrated for your bravery and resourcefulness. With the Whispering Woods safe once more, you prepared for the next adventure life had in store for you.",gpt-4-turbo,tiiuae/falcon-40b-instruct

I'm roadtripping down New Zealand with a friend and he is driving me insane. He hasn't enjoyed all the tours we've been on and doesn't want to chat about ANYTHING. We're a week into our trip and this is the quietest I've ever been when hanging out with another person as he rebuffs all my attempts at conversation. He wears his airpods in the car and around the accommodation - not that I've kept trying to talk to him. Honestly, he is bringing some seriously bad vibes to everything and it's ruining my trip.
We don't have anything booked in yet for the South Island, so I'm planning to ditch him in Wellington at the ferry. Probably book my own car in Picton and just relax alone for the rest of the trip. (Just thinking about it is such sharp relief that it makes me feel emotional. I'll pay whatever price I have to just to get away from him.)

""The Personal Record Matching project is a long-running effort to improve the efficiency of employment data processing. The project uses AI techniques to assign employment events to individuals in a database, resulting in a more accurate and streamlined process. 
The POC has demonstrated significant improvements in both speed and accuracy through the use of AI techniques. Our automated prediction process found matches 100 times faster than the hardcoded algorithm. Additionally, the number of manual checks has been reduced to 10%.
Since the POC, we have processed approximately 200k events and continuously improved the AI model. We have introduced cutting-edge language models that improve matching in cases such as nicknames, mistyped names, and can take emails-name similarity into consideration. Additionally, we have used these language models to improve indexing, allowing for real-time search and matching.

In terms of accuracy, the machine learning (ML) models used in the project have successfully identified previously overlooked matches. Examples of these matches have been provided in the appendix. Additionally, the ML models have improved over time, providing a process for tracking accuracy, identifying errors, and making further improvements.
However, even with these improvements, the current process still runs in batches and can be improved further. There is a clear need to streamline the process, remove blockers and reduce resources required to keep the project running. In the next section, we will propose a solution to close the loop and allow for regular updates to the person and applicant databases.
It is also worth mentioning that this development can potentially be used for other projects as well, such as a partnership with HourWork to help clean and process their data. This is a related project that can benefit from the advancements made in the Personal Record Matching project.
In this document, we will present the current state of the project, the challenges faced and the solution we propose to close the loop, allowing for weekly or even daily processing.""

""The Personal Record Matching project is a long-running effort to improve the efficiency of employment data processing. The project uses AI techniques to assign employment events to individuals in a database, resulting in a more accurate and streamlined process. 
The POC has demonstrated significant improvements in both speed and accuracy through the use of AI techniques. Our automated prediction process found matches 100 times faster than the hardcoded algorithm. Additionally, the number of manual checks has been reduced to 10%.
Since the POC, we have processed approximately 200k events and continuously improved the AI model. We have introduced cutting-edge language models that improve matching in cases such as nicknames, mistyped names, and can take emails-name similarity into consideration. Additionally, we have used these language models to improve indexing, allowing for real-time search and matching.

In terms of accuracy, the machine learning (ML) models used in the project have successfully identified previously overlooked matches. Examples of these matches have been provided in the appendix. Additionally, the ML models have improved over time, providing a process for tracking accuracy, identifying errors, and making further improvements.
However, even with these improvements, the current process still runs in batches and can be improved further. There is a clear need to streamline the process, remove blockers and reduce resources required to keep the project running. In the next section, we will propose a solution to close the loop and allow for regular updates to the person and applicant databases.
It is also worth mentioning that this development can potentially be used for other projects as well, such as a partnership with HourWork to help clean and process their data. This is a related project that can benefit from the advancements made in the Personal Record Matching project.
In this document, we will present the current state of the project, the challenges faced and the solution we propose to close the loop, allowing for weekly or even daily processing.""

3491,"Based on the following summary of a dungeons and dragons adventure, suggest 10 follow up stories: 

In the quaint village of Oakwood, you, a druid, were asked by Eadric, the village elder, to investigate the corruption spreading through the Whispering Woods. You spent the night at Innkeeper Alaric's Silver Stag Inn, learning what you could from the locals. The next morning, venturing into the woods, you took on the form of a squirrel to blend in with your surroundings and quickly travel through the forest. Communicating with the spirits of the forest, you discovered a ritual site where a group of goblins was performing a dark ceremony.

You dispatched several goblin lookouts before confronting the remaining goblins, who revealed that a goblin shaman named Kragthar was attempting to control the spirits of the forest using an ancient tome. You persuaded two goblins to help you stop Kragthar and learned that he was at the Moonstone Spire.

Upon arriving at the Moonstone Spire, you observed Kragthar and his hooded followers performing a ritual. You created a wall of fire to scare the followers before charging Kragthar in the form of a Grizzly Bear. After a fierce battle, you emerged victorious and stopped Kragthar's plans, saving the Whispering Woods from corruption. The two goblins were then free to return to their clan, liberated from Kragthar's control.

Inspecting the Moonstone Spire, you found it contained a complex combination of nature-based and arcane symbols, suggesting a deep connection between the two. You surmise that the spire and altar may have once been used for rituals and ceremonies aimed at maintaining balance between the natural and arcane energies within the Whispering Woods.

Returning to Oakwood, you were welcomed as a hero and celebrated for your bravery and resourcefulness. With the Whispering Woods safe once more, you prepared for the next adventure life had in store for you.",HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta,gpt-4-turbo

3728,"Based on the following summary of a dungeons and dragons adventure, suggest 10 follow up stories: 

In the quaint village of Oakwood, you, a druid, were asked by Eadric, the village elder, to investigate the corruption spreading through the Whispering Woods. You spent the night at Innkeeper Alaric's Silver Stag Inn, learning what you could from the locals. The next morning, venturing into the woods, you took on the form of a squirrel to blend in with your surroundings and quickly travel through the forest. Communicating with the spirits of the forest, you discovered a ritual site where a group of goblins was performing a dark ceremony.

You dispatched several goblin lookouts before confronting the remaining goblins, who revealed that a goblin shaman named Kragthar was attempting to control the spirits of the forest using an ancient tome. You persuaded two goblins to help you stop Kragthar and learned that he was at the Moonstone Spire.

Upon arriving at the Moonstone Spire, you observed Kragthar and his hooded followers performing a ritual. You created a wall of fire to scare the followers before charging Kragthar in the form of a Grizzly Bear. After a fierce battle, you emerged victorious and stopped Kragthar's plans, saving the Whispering Woods from corruption. The two goblins were then free to return to their clan, liberated from Kragthar's control.

Inspecting the Moonstone Spire, you found it contained a complex combination of nature-based and arcane symbols, suggesting a deep connection between the two. You surmise that the spire and altar may have once been used for rituals and ceremonies aimed at maintaining balance between the natural and arcane energies within the Whispering Woods.

Returning to Oakwood, you were welcomed as a hero and celebrated for your bravery and resourcefulness. With the Whispering Woods safe once more, you prepared for the next adventure life had in store for you.",huggyllama/llama-7b,gpt-4-turbo

3782,"Ok, we have an intro:

""The Personal Record Matching project is a long-running effort to improve the efficiency of employment data processing. The project uses AI techniques to assign employment events to individuals in a database, resulting in a more accurate and streamlined process. 
The POC has demonstrated significant improvements in both speed and accuracy through the use of AI techniques. Our automated prediction process found matches 100 times faster than the hardcoded algorithm. Additionally, the number of manual checks has been reduced to 10%.
Since the POC, we have processed approximately 200k events and continuously improved the AI model. We have introduced cutting-edge language models that improve matching in cases such as nicknames, mistyped names, and can take emails-name similarity into consideration. Additionally, we have used these language models to improve indexing, allowing for real-time search and matching.

In terms of accuracy, the machine learning (ML) models used in the project have successfully identified previously overlooked matches. Examples of these matches have been provided in the appendix. Additionally, the ML models have improved over time, providing a process for tracking accuracy, identifying errors, and making further improvements.
However, even with these improvements, the current process still runs in batches and can be improved further. There is a clear need to streamline the process, remove blockers and reduce resources required to keep the project running. In the next section, we will propose a solution to close the loop and allow for regular updates to the person and applicant databases.
It is also worth mentioning that this development can potentially be used for other projects as well, such as a partnership with HourWork to help clean and process their data. This is a related project that can benefit from the advancements made in the Personal Record Matching project.
In this document, we will present the current state of the project, the challenges faced and the solution we propose to close the loop, allowing for weekly or even daily processing.""

3854,"Based on the following summary of a dungeons and dragons adventure, suggest 10 follow up stories: 

In the quaint village of Oakwood, you, a druid, were asked by Eadric, the village elder, to investigate the corruption spreading through the Whispering Woods. You spent the night at Innkeeper Alaric's Silver Stag Inn, learning what you could from the locals. The next morning, venturing into the woods, you took on the form of a squirrel to blend in with your surroundings and quickly travel through the forest. Communicating with the spirits of the forest, you discovered a ritual site where a group of goblins was performing a dark ceremony.

You dispatched several goblin lookouts before confronting the remaining goblins, who revealed that a goblin shaman named Kragthar was attempting to control the spirits of the forest using an ancient tome. You persuaded two goblins to help you stop Kragthar and learned that he was at the Moonstone Spire.

Upon arriving at the Moonstone Spire, you observed Kragthar and his hooded followers performing a ritual. You created a wall of fire to scare the followers before charging Kragthar in the form of a Grizzly Bear. After a fierce battle, you emerged victorious and stopped Kragthar's plans, saving the Whispering Woods from corruption. The two goblins were then free to return to their clan, liberated from Kragthar's control.

Inspecting the Moonstone Spire, you found it contained a complex combination of nature-based and arcane symbols, suggesting a deep connection between the two. You surmise that the spire and altar may have once been used for rituals and ceremonies aimed at maintaining balance between the natural and arcane energies within the Whispering Woods.

Returning to Oakwood, you were welcomed as a hero and celebrated for your bravery and resourcefulness. With the Whispering Woods safe once more, you prepared for the next adventure life had in store for you.",gpt-4-turbo,huggyllama/llama-13b

3873,"Ok, we have an intro:

""The Personal Record Matching project is a long-running effort to improve the efficiency of employment data processing. The project uses AI techniques to assign employment events to individuals in a database, resulting in a more accurate and streamlined process. 
The POC has demonstrated significant improvements in both speed and accuracy through the use of AI techniques. Our automated prediction process found matches 100 times faster than the hardcoded algorithm. Additionally, the number of manual checks has been reduced to 10%.
Since the POC, we have processed approximately 200k events and continuously improved the AI model. We have introduced cutting-edge language models that improve matching in cases such as nicknames, mistyped names, and can take emails-name similarity into consideration. Additionally, we have used these language models to improve indexing, allowing for real-time search and matching.

In terms of accuracy, the machine learning (ML) models used in the project have successfully identified previously overlooked matches. Examples of these matches have been provided in the appendix. Additionally, the ML models have improved over time, providing a process for tracking accuracy, identifying errors, and making further improvements.
However, even with these improvements, the current process still runs in batches and can be improved further. There is a clear need to streamline the process, remove blockers and reduce resources required to keep the project running. In the next section, we will propose a solution to close the loop and allow for regular updates to the person and applicant databases.
It is also worth mentioning that this development can potentially be used for other projects as well, such as a partnership with HourWork to help clean and process their data. This is a related project that can benefit from the advancements made in the Personal Record Matching project.
In this document, we will present the current state of the project, the challenges faced and the solution we propose to close the loop, allowing for weekly or even daily processing.""

""The Personal Record Matching project is a long-running effort to improve the efficiency of employment data processing. The project uses AI techniques to assign employment events to individuals in a database, resulting in a more accurate and streamlined process. 
The POC has demonstrated significant improvements in both speed and accuracy through the use of AI techniques. Our automated prediction process found matches 100 times faster than the hardcoded algorithm. Additionally, the number of manual checks has been reduced to 10%.
Since the POC, we have processed approximately 200k events and continuously improved the AI model. We have introduced cutting-edge language models that improve matching in cases such as nicknames, mistyped names, and can take emails-name similarity into consideration. Additionally, we have used these language models to improve indexing, allowing for real-time search and matching.

In terms of accuracy, the machine learning (ML) models used in the project have successfully identified previously overlooked matches. Examples of these matches have been provided in the appendix. Additionally, the ML models have improved over time, providing a process for tracking accuracy, identifying errors, and making further improvements.
However, even with these improvements, the current process still runs in batches and can be improved further. There is a clear need to streamline the process, remove blockers and reduce resources required to keep the project running. In the next section, we will propose a solution to close the loop and allow for regular updates to the person and applicant databases.
It is also worth mentioning that this development can potentially be used for other projects as well, such as a partnership with HourWork to help clean and process their data. This is a related project that can benefit from the advancements made in the Personal Record Matching project.
In this document, we will present the current state of the project, the challenges faced and the solution we propose to close the loop, allowing for weekly or even daily processing.""

4111,"You should take the time to read the situation and problem carefully and give the best advice you can.

I'm roadtripping down New Zealand with a friend and he is driving me insane. He hasn't enjoyed all the tours we've been on and doesn't want to chat about ANYTHING. We're a week into our trip and this is the quietest I've ever been when hanging out with another person as he rebuffs all my attempts at conversation. He wears his airpods in the car and around the accommodation - not that I've kept trying to talk to him. Honestly, he is bringing some seriously bad vibes to everything and it's ruining my trip.
We don't have anything booked in yet for the South Island, so I'm planning to ditch him in Wellington at the ferry. Probably book my own car in Picton and just relax alone for the rest of the trip. (Just thinking about it is such sharp relief that it makes me feel emotional. I'll pay whatever price I have to just to get away from him.)
Obviously telling him he is ruining my trip with his negative energy isn't the best way to approach this.

In the quaint village of Oakwood, you, a druid, were asked by Eadric, the village elder, to investigate the corruption spreading through the Whispering Woods. You spent the night at Innkeeper Alaric's Silver Stag Inn, learning what you could from the locals. The next morning, venturing into the woods, you took on the form of a squirrel to blend in with your surroundings and quickly travel through the forest. Communicating with the spirits of the forest, you discovered a ritual site where a group of goblins was performing a dark ceremony.

You dispatched several goblin lookouts before confronting the remaining goblins, who revealed that a goblin shaman named Kragthar was attempting to control the spirits of the forest using an ancient tome. You persuaded two goblins to help you stop Kragthar and learned that he was at the Moonstone Spire.

Upon arriving at the Moonstone Spire, you observed Kragthar and his hooded followers performing a ritual. You created a wall of fire to scare the followers before charging Kragthar in the form of a Grizzly Bear. After a fierce battle, you emerged victorious and stopped Kragthar's plans, saving the Whispering Woods from corruption. The two goblins were then free to return to their clan, liberated from Kragthar's control.

Inspecting the Moonstone Spire, you found it contained a complex combination of nature-based and arcane symbols, suggesting a deep connection between the two. You surmise that the spire and altar may have once been used for rituals and ceremonies aimed at maintaining balance between the natural and arcane energies within the Whispering Woods.

4253,"You should take the time to read the situation and problem carefully and give the best advice you can.

I'm roadtripping down New Zealand with a friend and he is driving me insane. He hasn't enjoyed all the tours we've been on and doesn't want to chat about ANYTHING. We're a week into our trip and this is the quietest I've ever been when hanging out with another person as he rebuffs all my attempts at conversation. He wears his airpods in the car and around the accommodation - not that I've kept trying to talk to him. Honestly, he is bringing some seriously bad vibes to everything and it's ruining my trip.
We don't have anything booked in yet for the South Island, so I'm planning to ditch him in Wellington at the ferry. Probably book my own car in Picton and just relax alone for the rest of the trip. (Just thinking about it is such sharp relief that it makes me feel emotional. I'll pay whatever price I have to just to get away from him.)
Obviously telling him he is ruining my trip with his negative energy isn't the best way to approach this.
Any advice for the best approach so we can split amicably? Or at least not have an argument that ends with very hurt feelings?",gpt-4-turbo,gemini

""The Personal Record Matching project is a long-running effort to improve the efficiency of employment data processing. The project uses AI techniques to assign employment events to individuals in a database, resulting in a more accurate and streamlined process. 
The POC has demonstrated significant improvements in both speed and accuracy through the use of AI techniques. Our automated prediction process found matches 100 times faster than the hardcoded algorithm. Additionally, the number of manual checks has been reduced to 10%.
Since the POC, we have processed approximately 200k events and continuously improved the AI model. We have introduced cutting-edge language models that improve matching in cases such as nicknames, mistyped names, and can take emails-name similarity into consideration. Additionally, we have used these language models to improve indexing, allowing for real-time search and matching.

In terms of accuracy, the machine learning (ML) models used in the project have successfully identified previously overlooked matches. Examples of these matches have been provided in the appendix. Additionally, the ML models have improved over time, providing a process for tracking accuracy, identifying errors, and making further improvements.
However, even with these improvements, the current process still runs in batches and can be improved further. There is a clear need to streamline the process, remove blockers and reduce resources required to keep the project running. In the next section, we will propose a solution to close the loop and allow for regular updates to the person and applicant databases.
It is also worth mentioning that this development can potentially be used for other projects as well, such as a partnership with HourWork to help clean and process their data. This is a related project that can benefit from the advancements made in the Personal Record Matching project.
In this document, we will present the current state of the project, the challenges faced and the solution we propose to close the loop, allowing for weekly or even daily processing.""

4414,"Ok, we have an intro:

""The Personal Record Matching project is a long-running effort to improve the efficiency of employment data processing. The project uses AI techniques to assign employment events to individuals in a database, resulting in a more accurate and streamlined process. 
The POC has demonstrated significant improvements in both speed and accuracy through the use of AI techniques. Our automated prediction process found matches 100 times faster than the hardcoded algorithm. Additionally, the number of manual checks has been reduced to 10%.
Since the POC, we have processed approximately 200k events and continuously improved the AI model. We have introduced cutting-edge language models that improve matching in cases such as nicknames, mistyped names, and can take emails-name similarity into consideration. Additionally, we have used these language models to improve indexing, allowing for real-time search and matching.

In terms of accuracy, the machine learning (ML) models used in the project have successfully identified previously overlooked matches. Examples of these matches have been provided in the appendix. Additionally, the ML models have improved over time, providing a process for tracking accuracy, identifying errors, and making further improvements.
However, even with these improvements, the current process still runs in batches and can be improved further. There is a clear need to streamline the process, remove blockers and reduce resources required to keep the project running. In the next section, we will propose a solution to close the loop and allow for regular updates to the person and applicant databases.
It is also worth mentioning that this development can potentially be used for other projects as well, such as a partnership with HourWork to help clean and process their data. This is a related project that can benefit from the advancements made in the Personal Record Matching project.
In this document, we will present the current state of the project, the challenges faced and the solution we propose to close the loop, allowing for weekly or even daily processing.""

In the quaint village of Oakwood, you, a druid, were asked by Eadric, the village elder, to investigate the corruption spreading through the Whispering Woods. You spent the night at Innkeeper Alaric's Silver Stag Inn, learning what you could from the locals. The next morning, venturing into the woods, you took on the form of a squirrel to blend in with your surroundings and quickly travel through the forest. Communicating with the spirits of the forest, you discovered a ritual site where a group of goblins was performing a dark ceremony.

You dispatched several goblin lookouts before confronting the remaining goblins, who revealed that a goblin shaman named Kragthar was attempting to control the spirits of the forest using an ancient tome. You persuaded two goblins to help you stop Kragthar and learned that he was at the Moonstone Spire.

Upon arriving at the Moonstone Spire, you observed Kragthar and his hooded followers performing a ritual. You created a wall of fire to scare the followers before charging Kragthar in the form of a Grizzly Bear. After a fierce battle, you emerged victorious and stopped Kragthar's plans, saving the Whispering Woods from corruption. The two goblins were then free to return to their clan, liberated from Kragthar's control.

Inspecting the Moonstone Spire, you found it contained a complex combination of nature-based and arcane symbols, suggesting a deep connection between the two. You surmise that the spire and altar may have once been used for rituals and ceremonies aimed at maintaining balance between the natural and arcane energies within the Whispering Woods.

Returning to Oakwood, you were welcomed as a hero and celebrated for your bravery and resourcefulness. With the Whispering Woods safe once more, you prepared for the next adventure life had in store for you.",gpt-4-turbo,mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1

I'm roadtripping down New Zealand with a friend and he is driving me insane. He hasn't enjoyed all the tours we've been on and doesn't want to chat about ANYTHING. We're a week into our trip and this is the quietest I've ever been when hanging out with another person as he rebuffs all my attempts at conversation. He wears his airpods in the car and around the accommodation - not that I've kept trying to talk to him. Honestly, he is bringing some seriously bad vibes to everything and it's ruining my trip.
We don't have anything booked in yet for the South Island, so I'm planning to ditch him in Wellington at the ferry. Probably book my own car in Picton and just relax alone for the rest of the trip. (Just thinking about it is such sharp relief that it makes me feel emotional. I'll pay whatever price I have to just to get away from him.)
Obviously telling him he is ruining my trip with his negative energy isn't the best way to approach this.
